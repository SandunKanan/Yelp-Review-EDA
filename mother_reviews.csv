To start, they served the best ham I have ever had. Hands down. I totally ""pigged out"" on it. It was seriously some divine swine. Oink oink!!
And on the side was some serious cabbage. I don't know what they cooked it in, but I would bathe in whatever magical liquid they cooked this scrumptious side dish in. Triple oink!!

The service is friendly and personable. The food is down home and reminds me of what my grandmother would make. We all enjoyed our amazing breakfasts with huge portions and affordable pricing. 

I had the baked ham and grits. The baked ham was the most delicious ham I have ever eaten, but please don't tell my mother. It was juicy and flavorful with five huge pieces. I am craving it even now as I am writing this review.
The biscuits were homemade, huge and fluffy (the size of your palm). The butter looked homemade, as well. The jelly came in individual containers, which one would infer the jelly was homemade, also. The omelets were fluffy with many ingredients - no skimping on anything at Mother's. My friend had the breakfast special and she really enjoyed it. 

I truly wanted ham and grits every day after being at Mother's. Our plan was to return a second time during our stay, but we were not able to make it back. We would have loved to have eaten here often during our time in New Orleans. 

Mother's is not an upscale establishment. This is a plain, honest, local diner and the atmosphere is like being in your grandmother's kitchen. The table and chairs are old, the place needs a fresh coat of paint, and the floor needs repair. If this bothers you, this is not the place to eat.

I was told by three people to try this place. Lets just say that I was not impressed. Of course it's a big tourist stop and we had to wait in a line outside to order. Once we did get inside it was crowded and rushed. You order first, take your ticket to your seat and a waiter will come get your ticket and get your food. While the waitress we had was really nice and friendly, I did not like my food. I order the Famous Ferdi Special and it was not special. After standing inline waiting to order, I was scanning the room and looking at everyone elses food to see what looked good. A lot of people had this sandwich, so I was sure it would be good. I was disappointed. My sandwich was cold and the entire bottom half was soggy. I understand the sandwich has a lot of juice, but I looked around and only mine was soggy. I think it has been sitting awhile. It did not taste good. I ended up eating the top portion of the bread only and had that as my sandwich, I just the top as my bottom (they cut the sandwich in half, so I used the top from the other half as my bottom and ended up only eating half the sandwich). The flavor wasn't even that good. I hated every minute of it. But I at least tried it.

I realized when I got there that this was the place that was featured in Man v. Food a while back. It was also Mardi Gras that day. Accordingly, there were a lot of tourists, so the line was ridiculously long. However it moved fast, and we only waited for like 30 minutes.

There were two of us, but we ordered (possibly) half the menu:

Crawfish etouffee, shrimp creole, fried chicken, red beans and rice, turnip greens, and the ferdi special. 

(Don't judge.)

My favorite thing was the chicken. The fried chicken takes 25 minutes for it to come out (and they warn you, right there on the menu) but it was delicious and worth the wait! The crust was so light and not as greasy as you'd think (I hate it when you bite into fried chicken, and instead of getting a mouthful of juicy chicken, you get a mouthful of hot oil. SICK). And it was seasoned perfectly. LOVED it.

The other remarkable thing was that the service was really nice and everyone was super cheerful, and seemed happy to be there (even though they were working on a NOLA holiday and there was a line 300 miles long out the door). I loved that when we pointed out that they accidentally brought us seafood gumbo instead of the shrimp creole that we ordered, there was no attitude, no argument, just a simple ""sorry about that!"" a smile, and they just brought the correct order, no questions asked. It was refreshing.

The other food we ordered was good enough, but not particularly remarkable.

Good things first- line was not too long but it moved pretty quickly. I got the special red beans and rice with a meat choice and 2 sides. My husband got the same. The price was reasonable. Food amounts generous. Turnip greens were yummy. French fries thin and crispy!  And the brownie was rich and fudgy!  All that was great stuff. 
Now for the not so good--the red beans and rice was pretty tasteless. Not spicy, not flavorful. I've made better from a box. I got the debris as my meat side. This is supposed to be beef pieces that is the leftovers from roast beef. It was basically shredded roast beef cooked in au jus. Again tasteless. Nothing AT ALL spectacular. Or worthy of a line. 
My husband got fries, grits as his sides and chose the black ham as his meat choice. To clarify, they warn that the black ham (caramelized outer crust if baked ham) is in short supply and rarely available after 8 am. Upon ordering, he asked for black ham, they checked to see if any available, cook said yes. So happy times!  Got order, baked ham instead of black on plate. Apparently, cook mistaken. Hubby does not like baked ham. And this ham was again like the rest, tasteless. And dry. No moisture to be found. Surprised bc it's known as best baked ham in WORLD. ITS NOT. 
Service- we saw the server three times. Once to pick up our receipt for order. Second to bring order. Third to bring the rest of our order bc she didn't bring it all the first time. No refills on drinks bc she never came back. Perhaps needed to do that ourselves but customers six people deep around drink area awaiting for to-go orders.

When you get in you are greeted by some random looking guy not dressed like the other staff, advising you to take a menu and laughingly directs you to the back of the line.  The menu is a two sided menu, with breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  As we approach the ordering counter we here the cashier telling everybody breakfast only.  Of course a sign explaining this or something on the menu that indicates the time between breakfast or lunch would be helpful.  Needless to say if there is that much confusion in ordering you can imagine how confused this place might be.

We ended up ordering a shrimp creole omelette and a crawfish √©touff√©e omelette with a side order of Ham.  The breakfast came with biscuits and grits.  The shrimp creole omelette was my favorite nice spice and nice sized shrimp.  The crawfish √©touff√©e omelette was ok, but I have had better crawfish √©touff√©e at other establishments.

The only thing that stuck out as needing improvement is their system. You wait in line, order at a counter, and then sit down and wait for them to bring you your food. So you wait outside until you're allowed inside by the guard (literally a NO Sheriff) who then sends you into a different line.

If you're familiar with Carnegie Deli in NYC, you know what I mean.

Some high spots:  Sweet Potato Pie was pretty good, even pre-sliced - I got a slice to go - and their Bread Pudding with sauce looked homemade-on-site.  The turnip greens were delicious, fresh, properly seasoned and cooked.  

But from here, it's all downhill:

The Ferdie:  A soggy roll (not fresh, definitely not baked this week ...) piled with too much overcooked pot roast (""debris""), more flavorless, overcooked chunks of grocery-store ham, a few shreds of slaw and slathered with nasty mayonnaise does not a Po-Boy make.  

The Catfish:  Battered heavily with literally NO seasoning at all.  I've routinely eaten better fish out of a freezer bag.  The batter was thick, heavy and starchy.  Again, flavorless.

The Red Beans and Rice:  Mushy and overcooked, without a hint of seasoning.  If, as advertised, andouille or other sausage (or meat at all) was involved in making this dish, it must have been waved over the bean pot on the way to another dish.

The Service:  Back to ""historic"" tourist places:  The line to place orders, the ""seat yourself"" walkthrough, the collecting of tickets and the surly cashier didn't, unfortunately, translate to efficiency in delivering the food.  It took 30+ minutes to get everyone in our party of 10 served, by which time the first recipients' food was cold and sandwiches even soggier.  Drinks were not topped and refills were not offered, nor seconds for those who ordered bottled beers.  You can tell a lot about a place by staff attitudes: these servers were overworked, unappreciated and unhappy.  Top it off with the gruff direction to ""Exit out the FRONT door"" (a la the Soup Nazi).  You get the idea.

New Orleans is supposed to be hospitable, fun, and casual with a deep well of culture and spice.  Mother's is definitely NOT that place.",2018-04-04 18:31:11,9.0,2048,9.0,0.025,0.025,0.1988737822087165,0.1988737822087165

From the looks of the food while waiting to order, nothing looked appetizing to me. I hate to waste my money on bad food, so I decided to settle for something smaller and ordered some jambalaya. It says it comes with andouille sausage and chicken in it... The sausage wasn't andouille, and the chicken... Where was it? It was none in it at all! I went with a group of 4, and no one got anything that was good. One person got a shrimp po boy. I thought the shrimp was suppose to be hot... Maybe this day it was a special day and they were only serving the ""cold shrimp po boy."" A couple people had leftovers, enough to take back to the hotel to eat later... Yeah... They didn't do that. 

The prices at this place are ridiculous. The inside was filthy. Food all over the place on the floor. Someone told me that's how they do it in New Orleans, but I didn't go to any other restaurant that looked like this. I was just waiting and anticipating seeing rat come out from under something.

""We're not allowed to accept tips, but if you want to tip, please tip and we'll take it."" Whaaaaaaaat!?!?!?!?

You order at the counter and seat yourself but a server will bring your food to your table. Despite the huge crowd, there are plenty of tables in the back room so there was no trouble finding a seat.
I was told you must have a debris sandwich but I don't usually eat beef so I went for the turkey Ferdi which came with Turkey and roast beef debris. The turkey was very good, roasted sliced turkey that reminded me of thanksgiving left overs. The debris was juicy of course and had good flavor but I felt it needed a little salt. The bread the sandwich came on is really what made the meal. Soft, Fresh, delish French bread. Great sandwich and the huge portion makes it worth the price. I only ate half of it and I was very full.

In fact, it took all of an hour before I found myself at the home of the Ferdi. 

The menu begins with a definition of debris, the drippings and ends of the beef whilst cooking, which are then piled back on.  The menu you get while standing in a long, but rather quick queue that runs along an old, charming brick number in the CBD.  

I had come with friends who had never been to New Orleans -- Mother's is a decent introduction to how things work a little differently here.  Everyone is nice, a little rough around the edges and well-versed in getting people in and out, an efficiency that comes with the practice of having a line out the door every day.  There's no tipping, which at first we'll seem a little strange, until you realize service is provided by an army of servers each bringing out whatever is ready, when it's ready.  The place is huge -- the hold up is getting orders ordered and orders out, not seating.  You can wander around and find room after room of four tops in this old brick building.  

Eventually your meal shows up in parts and if you're like most other people, you've ordered the Ferdi ($12), a po' boy made of ham, roast beef and that aforementioned debris, or some variety of it.  

Mother's was fairly well known amongst the group that others had, without discussion with the rest of the group, added it to their own personal to-do lists for the weekend.  I had a very fond memory of it from my last visit, which must have been a few years before.  

Sadly, I was a little letdown.  

The sandwich is good, though a little skimpily filled.  Mother's has become a bit of an assembly line and I don't think the end product lived up to my memory of it or the expectations of others in the group.  This coming from someone who finds the old, worn environment and occasionally curt service as just part of New Orleans.",2013-06-24 20:54:40,15.0,2029,15.0,0.03826530612244898,0.03826530612244898,0.3330046021554029,0.3330046021554029

However I always tried to avoid touristic places but even locals and other friends recommended it so here we are!

First off, there will be mostly have a line so be ready for it and try to go during off hours like a late lunch. The building is old so is the inside. This is probably the divest, most casual place I have ever eaten but it definitely brings some character and history. After a long line outside and inside the place, it was time to order. So apparently they are famous for their ham/roast beef sandwich but I would kill myself to go to New Orleans for a turkey'like sub. I then ended with the true cajun experience with a shrimp po'boy, jambalaya, etouffe and gumbo. All items were really good, coming from fresh produce and made in front of you (I am not joking, you walk in front of the kitchen lol). While the po'boy hits the spot, it was fairly basic which I was expecting some secret seasoning or magic cajun remoulade to go with it. The trio bowl as I will call it was definitely a major highlight. Every restaurant in Nola will claim to have the best jambayala or gumbo or etouffe but Mother's is truly good at it. I do mean truly which means that it is probably how people have done it since the old days or like your grand'ma used to make it. Next time, I will just go with those 3 with a personal preference for the etouffe...

If you are looking for a great, cheap and true new orleans (cajun) food experience, this is IT!

We walked into this cafeteria-type hole in the wall and were faced with at least 6 ladies staring back at us from behind the counter. None of them offered to assist us.

Having just dropped my mother off at the airport, we thought we would begin this voyage with a stop at Mothers..

It had been raining all morning so we were able to find a lull in the church crowd and jumped right into the line at this well known eatery.  We grabbed a menu and were shuffled forward towards the register where you place your order.  While the line may seem long, don't dally to much over the menu because you will in a few minutes find yourself face to face with a person who does not seem to thrilled, or helpful, ready to take your order.

Having had less than a few minutes to puruse the menu Benson and I chose the Ferdi Special (*** 1/2 stars)  It basically consists of a fine bread sandwiched piled full ham roast beef and what looked like pulled pork but I later found out was  ""debris"",  bits of beef that fall off during the roasting process soaked in juices. 

I wish I had taken more time to look at the menu, because the table next to me had some really good looking sides such as bbq beans and potato salad.  With the line as long as it was and this only being the beginning of our journey, it just wasn't worth getting back in line.

This place was recommended by the driver of the hotel shuttle, so we knew it had to be good. I also recalled seeing it mentioned on the Food Network somewhere, and that's always a good sign. We later found out that Mother's Restaurant was more than just good, it was LEGENDARY. I mean, it's been up and running since 1938 and hasn't changed much since then. Places that stay open for that long are definitely doing something right.

When we walked in, I immediately noticed the ""old school"" vibe the place had. I could also tell it was diner/cafeteria style dining, which I didn't mind as long as the food was good. The walls were absolutely COVERED with framed photos of people who were important visitors to the restaurant in some way, whether they were famous, local heroes, or just loyal, longtime patrons. It gave the restaurant that ""family-owned-and-run"" feel for sure.

My husband and I decided once again to split an entree because they came with lots of side items. It took a while to decide, as usual, but we finally agreed on the Seafood Platter: oysters, shrimp, and catfish (all fried) plus red beans & rice, grits, jamalaya, and shrimp etouffee--a complete cornucopia of classic cajun cuisine! And WOW was it a lot of food! Even between two people we couldn't finish it all. And as you can see in the photo, the server was cool with us splitting--even gave us an extra plate and everything. 

Now, most of these foods I've had before in one form or another, except for the fried oysters or shrimp etouffee. Both were awesome. What I liked about the fried seafood was that the breading was light and crispy, not greasy. The jambalaya was nice and flavorful, definitely good. The grits were a bit bland though, needed cheese maybe. And the rice and beans could've used more rice and less sauce to my taste. BUT Overall the meal was wonderful and would certainly recommend Mother's Restaurant to anyone who's in New Orleans and is looking for some honest-to-goodness cajun food with great prices and a no-frills atmosphere.


Bottom Line: Come hungry, and don't expect classy surroundings...this is REAL Cajun food!

I asked what they liked and was told that they liked all their food items... (not that helpful)... so we decided to go the next morning for breakfast.

It was only few blocks away, walked in and if you are first time visitor, then you will get lost as to how their system works - so here it is - walk in, grab a menu and once you have decided, go up to the counter, which is by the other door, go grab a table and give your receipt to the server that comes to your table.

I'm thinking... um ok.

So did what the guy told me to do... grabbed the menu, looked and since it was breakfast, options were limited... I went with Grits with Meat, others went with Crawfish √âtouff√©e Omelet and breakfast special.

Grits with meat - the meat was excellent, left over from the prime rib, but the grit was subpar... it was missing something, wasn't sure what it was, but the meat made up for it.

To our dismay, the cashiers refused let him order a grilled cheese because it was on the kids menu and he was over 12 (clearly). We explained the situation, but they wouldn't budge.

We walked out.  Outside, another employee explained that yes, it was ridiculous and that they too weren't allowed to order the grilled cheese.

Clearly, many kids menus indicate they are for 12 and under - typically because the price point is lower.

Seriously, Mother's is like the restaurant version of the TARDIS. In any case, we stumbled upon this place because it was down the street from where we were and a relatively easy walking distance for my grandparents. The line, from the outside, seemed kind of intimidating, but barring malfunctions with the cash registers, the line moves by very fast. 

I went with the Ferdi, which is pretty much everything that I love in a sandwich between two lovely pieces of bread. There's a lot of meat, there is ""debris"" (something I discovered and fell in love with on this trip to the south) and it's French dipped. Nope, it really can't get better than that. Granted, we ended up going there twice and the sandwich was a little more dry on the second stop, but it still remained the highlight of my stop there. Delicious. Get it. 

The other food was pretty good. I tried bits and pieces of what everyone else got, but even at the 2/3 smaller sandwich size, the Ferdi is pretty much going to be the end game of your eating for the next few hours, if not the rest of the day. 

The jambalaya was pretty good. The sausages are too. The red beans and rice were okay, but I think I've had better elsewhere.

Johnny's, Sammy's, Mahony's, Mother's, or one of the other 25 places in New Orleans that touts to have the best. Well, I suppose that depends on what you get, but I think there's a reason that it has more then 700 reviews now. It's freakin' good! 

Went there a few weeks ago and had the Debris Po'Boy ($10), a draft domestic beer (~$3.50), and a large side of Jambalaya (~$6.00). The Debris Po'Boy is da BOMB! I haven't been back to New Orleans since sometime in 2006 (pre-Katrina), but it is just as good as I remember it. 

Basically, you order at the counter, they give you a stand-up number (to identify your order), you seat yourself, and they bring it to you shortly thereafter. Regarding service, this is not fine dining, and I get the feeling that New Orleans is known for their somewhat mouthy service and less then the cleanest environments. However, if you've been to the city before, you know that's just part of their charm. So, if you can get over yourself and focus on the food (as you should), then you'll find there are some really great restaurants in the city. So, surly service and all (okay...I was wearing a Falcons shirt and maybe that kind of brought that on), the food is damn good. 

The Debris Po'Boy is served on French Bread (slightly toasted) with the Roast Beef that has fallen off the skewer, is then captured from the juices, and put into a sandwich. I got it dressed, which at Mother's is shredded green cabbage, tomatoes, and mayo. Now, the Jambalaya was decent, but I think they put a little too much butter in there so that detracted from the flavor of the Andouille Sausage and spicy chicken and rice. However, it's good to cut the flavor of the Debris Po'Boy with something else. 

Oh....and we happened to go at a more off-peak time, so we didn't have to wait in a giant line or anything, which was great. So, be strategic about going there. If you roll up on a Saturday at 12 noon...wow...fancy that...there's a line! Come at 2pm, there will be way less people. The bathrooms were moderately clean, so that's a plus for this place too.

I know this is crazy, but we were looking everywhere for breakfast (like NOLA doesn't have any restaurants or anything) and we finally just decided to go here because a) it's on every NOLA must-do list b) it served breakfast and lunch c) we were interested in seeing if it lives up to its reputation. 

We got there around 11, and there was maybe a 10 minute wait. We were able to look at the menu, which was impressive.

We walked in and waited in line to order. We took in the decor and people- the staff was friendly, the customers looked happy, and the food looked excellent. 

We basically had an order of each meal- my brother had the three pancakes with grits, my dad had the debris, and I had the ham dinner meal. 

The pancakes were huge and fluffy, and the maple syrup smelled so divine. The grits came with slabs of butter on the side. The grits had a nice texture, but needed hot sauce and butter. 
My dad said his debris was nothing special, even though it looked delicious- the roast beef juice was dripping down the sides and the bread was sopping up all the flavor. 
My ham dinner was a winner! The ham was just like they advertised: sweet, smokey, and tender. I had three sides with it: collard greens, green beans and tomatoes, and red beans and rice. It's obvious that ham is mother's specialty, because it was in EVERYTHING. Not that I'm complaining. But if you're Jewish, sorry. 
The green beans were sooooooooooo surprisingly good. The greens were like any other greens, and the red beans weren't anything special. 
Another surprise: the lemonade is amazing! If you're familiar with chick-fil-a lemonade, this is its hotter older sister.

I ordered the large Ferdi's Special with a cup of crawfish etoufee, and they were delicious! What really makes the Ferdi Special so special is the debris, which is essentially roast beef au jus, with the crusty parts of the roast beef mixed in the the juice. If you enjoy French Dip sandwiches, then this is one of the finest examples anywhere. 

The crawfish etoufee is labeled ""mild"" on the menu and while it was lacking in heat, it was still packing a lot of flavor, and the crawfish tails were sweet and tender.

I think about 1 1/2 of the stars I knocked off were due to bad advice from other people, so let me start by saying I'll definitely give this place a second chance when I'm back in town with a little more time on my hands.

I went to Mothers for lunch while at a business function a few blocks away, because someone else who'd been here before and was old enough to know said ""If you want the REAL New Orleans, you go to Mothers.""  That person also said that you had to go for breakfast or lunch because Mothers didn't serve dinner.  ???  When I got to Mothers and finally reached the business end of the mile long line, the sign on the door said they were open 7 am to 10 pm most if not all days of the week, so that was Miss Information No. 1.  Someone Else, let's call him ""Al"" cuz he looks like an ""Al"" on vacation in his doofy shorts and Hawaiian shirt, who was also from out of town but had et here before, said he first came on the recommendation of a taxi driver after he badgered the cabbie ""so where do YOU eat?""  I don't know what time someone driving a cab would come to Mothers to avoid the line or if there's a secret backdoor or password that locals only know to avoid standing around for an hour for a sammitch, as I understand the line is 30-40 minutes long much of the day, but whatevs.  It's true that Mothers is a dern sight more authentic lunch-counter looking than most of the French Quarter a few blocks away, even if most of the people eating in the joint seem to be from Out of Town Looking for the Real New Orleans. 

Anyway, having already walked numerous blocks through a pretty dead part of town, I decided to brave the line, which was maybe back to the parking lot and therefore not bad as lines for lunch in NoLA seem to go.  The restaurant is teeny inside and they let people in by batches maybe 30-40 at a time because that's all they can serve and seat at once.  This explains why I stood there for a half hour watching like 20 people come out but nobody going in to take their place. 

I really didn't have much beef with the restaurant - it cant help being popular and indeed I'm sure it's happy about that.  I did start to want to maim the people standing in line around me, none of whom were from the area, and all of whom seemed to be competing in a death match with a group of Vegas tourists for Idiots of the Year Award.  The girl in back of me was wondering if she would be able to order any vegetarian food in Mothers, a restaurant that is widely publicized for its baked ham and other carnivorous dishes.  As it turned out she was happy with some eggs, but standing online for Mothers to get vegetarian food is like expecting steak on the buffet at a PETA convention.  Veggie Gurl and her pals were also fretting constantly about did they come to the restaurant at a bad time, because it was taking too long in their opinion to get in.  Ahead of me there was Al advising Veggie Gurl to try the ""debris po'boy"", which he had had before, and which he explained as being the pieces of meat that fall off the baked ham and land in the grease, so the sandwich is ham and grease, and the grease gives it the flavor, and you'll like it ""if you like grease"".   Although Veggie Gurl was not interested in grease (and in fact thought Al was discussing ""grits"" for 10 minutes till that got straightened out), I thought maybe I would try the ""debris"" as it's supposed to be a specialty of the house.

I finally got in there and placed my order.  It's a nice little funky cafeteria place with a weird no-tipping policy, and all of the staff who took my order and cleaned up the tables and so forth were extremely nice.  I had read before that Mother's featured ""surly"" New Orleans service and given the crush of people besieging the place all day and how hard the cookers and servers were working, I would not have begrudged them an attitude in the slightest, especially having to deal with the likes of my fellow linestanders, but the help was nice as pie.  Absolutely no attitude anywhere, just a lot of honeys and babys and man do I wish I had servers that nice in about 10 other cities.  

I ordered the 2/3 debris po'boy and a cup of etoufee.  Here's where Miss Information No. 2 comes in:  the ""debris"" is nothing like Al described.  It is basically hash in some kind of weird vinegary tasting pot likker.  It is not particularly greasy, nor particularly flavorful either unless you want to drench it with Tabasco or salt (unfortunately the shaker at my table was empty). It is not identifiable as ham but rather tastes like boiled mystery meat with mustard on it and a way soggy bun, like something you'd get at a bad school cafeteria.  In short, not worth a 40 minute line stand at lunch.  The etouffee, by contrast, was A+ five star excellent and I wish i'd just bought a big bowl of that instead, which I will do someday when I give Mothers another chance.",2009-03-08 22:35:17,37.0,4945,37.0,0.03842159916926272,0.03842159916926272,0.5261609053142318,0.5261609053142318

It wasn't originally on our list of places to see, but our airport shuttle driver spoke such high regards for Mother's saying it was the best New Orleans has to offer. So after checking in to our hotel, we walked over to Mother's and there was a huge crowd outside the door! We fell in line behind a super nice couple that told us that anytime they visit New Orleans, they make a point to stop at Mother's for a meal. They raaaaaved about the red beans and rice side and the po boys. We finally made it to the front of the line and was escorted into the restaurant. There were a ton of empty tables/seats and you order your food at the register and it's brought to you. The line falls right next to the food that they're preparing which you'd think would help with getting excited for the meal to come, but it was not an appetizing scene whatsoever. The kitchen area was filthy and the food looked like it had been sitting there for awhile. I tried to forget what it looked like when we made it to the front of the line. I ordered the fried catfish, shrimp and red beans and rice. My boyf ordered the Debris po boy. After giving your order, you seat yourself wherever you'd like in the restaurant. The space was huge! Unfortunately, it was also very dirty. The floors looked like only children had been eating there (so much food spilled/wasted) and the chairs/tables were the same. There were bussers/the same people who brought our food to us. Don't forget to order your condiments or any other special requests at the register because the staff who brings you your food are not waitresses by any means. If you forgot to order something (in my case, I forgot to mention I'd like tarter sauce), you had to fall in line again. The food finally came out and I ate my meal atop a dirty table and sat on a chair that wobbled (uneven floors). The fried catfish and shrimp were heavily breaded. Granted, the fish and shrimp tasted very fresh and the breading was decent. The biggest disappointment was the sought-after red beans and rice. The rice was hard, the beans were incredibly soupy and it just felt like I was drinking the side dish. I had about 2 bites before I quit. It was not edible. K's Debris po boy was soggy on the bottom, making it difficult to enjoy. However, the meat was seasoned/marinated really well. Beware the pickles! SO MANY PICKLES on this sammy.

Saturday morning when walking by, there was literally a line out the door and around the block! It must be good!

So Sunday morning we decided to go ahead and check it out. Line was long, but not as long as we'd seen it the day before, so we hopped on in and waited. Surprisingly, it moves pretty quick, and it's set up to order at a register, and they then bring your food to the table of your choice.

I got the John G po' boy (a small, which is HUGE) which came with house smoked turkey, ham and ""debris"" which is a house specialty meat you'll read about in their menu. It was pretty great. My boyfriend's po' boy however, was THE po' boy to get there, the breakfast po' boy with cheese, scrambled eggs, and a house made spicy sausage. It was SO yummy! Like I said, the po' boys are enormous so feel free to split with a friend, or bring the rest home for late night drunk munchies like we did - as you could imagine, they seemed to be even better at 2am after a night on Bourbon Street! 

A little bit pricey, two po' boys and a side of potato salad came up to $30, but portions are large, and the experience was great - good food, friendly service, and very quick, which is just what we were lookin' for to start our Sunday in NOLA.",2016-04-12 01:43:28,27.0,1388,27.0,0.1,0.1,0.7247179715782757,0.7247179715782757

We arrived and found a place in the back of the line at 8:00pm.  After waiting for 20 minutes, we found ourselves facing the windows to the kitchen.  We noticed that employees were heating previously prepared, clear plastic bags of sauce in the kitchen. We weren't sure what to think of it, but kept waiting in line.  After waiting over an hour, we finally had the chance to order in the restaurant.  I ordered a crawfish √©touff√©e platter with potato salad and red beans with rice.

He returned with our food 15 minutes later, almost 1.5 hours since we first got into line outside the restaurant.

When my traveling companion and I first put our fork into our meals, we did so with great expectations.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed.  My √©touff√©e had very little crawfish, and was lacking in flavor.  It tasted bland.  The potato salad was also bland, and was quite dry.  I can make better at home.  The beans also had very little flavor.  I'm not sure if it is because the kitchen staff is reheating previously prepared food, as we saw outside the restaurant, but the food just had very little flavor, and did not taste that great.  My roommate also got the crawfish √©touff√©e with ham, and they were also both bland.  In comparison to other meals that we have had elsewhere during our stay in New Orleans, this meal was completely forgettable.  There are many other, better restaurants in New Orleans.

We ended up getting a fried chicken sandwich, the ferdi (roast beef, au jus, ham) and an oyster sandwich. Upon the big guys advice, I got a side of potato salad. All the food was great, reasonably priced for the size of the dishes, and came out quickly. The potato salad was some of the best I've had.

So you cant sample here, so I just got their most popular item, the Ferdi Special, which came with their house baked ham, roast beef, debri, and gravy (and I asked for extra gravy on the side - nods off to Adam Richmond). I also got the crawfish ettuffle since that was the only thing I did not get at the Acme Oyster House. OMG ettuffle is delicious. Not too salty, (which was a problem at Acme), it has a broth which probably has a ton of butter and flour (or some sort of thickener), the crawfish cooked delicately with the flavor of the sea from the crawfish influsing into the broth very distinctly. The crawfish was sweet, tender, and fell apart with minimal effort in your mouth. No tough overcooked crawfish here. The ettouffle comes served over white rice, which when you are paying $8.25 for a small cup seems kinda a cheap move. Why cant they give me a whole cup of ettoufle with a side of rice. There's also another meat, most likely a fish in it. Altogether, this is probably the best thing that I had in New Orleans so far. More than anything, this reminds me of a good thick clam chowder, except with crawfish instead of clams. 

The Ferdi Special was alright. The broth was kinda flavorless, and to be honest, the best part of the sandwich for me was the pickles and mustard, which was a good combination with the lightly salty meat and gravy. Correction, the best part is the free pepper oil on the side. It was absolutely awesome. Sweet, sour and spicy at the same time, I ended up killing my sandwich with it. 

 Well the chicken and sausage.The jambalaya is a bit less salty than the jambalaya at Acme, it also has a bit more of a spicy kick to it. An interesting note is that the sausage here is sliced and the chicken is pulled. I feel that this is a bit better than the other way at Acme. The chicken stays tender and chewable, and the sausage (which naturally has more fat gives the jambalaya an additional component almost becoming a compliment to the dish rather than depending on the rice as a medium

He jumbo however is better at Acme. The chicken in my jumbo is dry, and the jumbo just isn't as flavorful as the darker jumbo at Acme. There is also less meat in this jumbo. The soup is just thinner. It's not as salty or as spicy. Again, the sausage is sliced thick, but in this case, I like it better chopped up like at Acme. 

Overall, I would say that this place makes the Louisiana classics a lot better than Acme. So if you want good jambalaya, entouffe, or gumbo, come here.

The diner is a glorified dive full of local culture.  Mother's is located in the heart of the Central Business District, leading to a large lunchtime crowd that forms a line down the block.  Upon your arrival at the main doorway, a dedicated bouncer will grant you permission to enter and place your order.  As you inch towards the cashier, you will pass the meal assemblers and their buffet of saucy ingredients.  The cashiers are not overly friendly, and I was advised not to customize my menu selection, because ""they are like the Soup Nazi; they will decide how to make your sandwich, whether you order it that way or not.""

I placed my order for a Grilled Chicken Po-Boy and tested my luck by requesting no mayonnaise.  After we ordered, my friend and I claimed a table in the large rear seating area.  A friendly, older woman greeted us and promised to deliver our meals in a prompt manner.  Our sandwiches quickly arrived; however, mine was not assembled as ordered.  My chicken was fried, and it was laced with mayo as well.  Apparently, I had been correctly forewarned regarding my customization.  The gracious server apologized and promised to do her best to get me the right sandwich as soon as possible.  Of course, it was then returned to me as the requested grilled chicken version but still with the fatty condiment.  At this point, my friend had already finished her entire sandwich, so I just wound up scrapping off the mayo.  Sure it was an annoyance, but the marinated chicken and doughy French bread still delighted me.  The perfectly grilled chicken was covered in tasty cajun spices.  My friend had ordered the Famous Ferdi Special, a savory blend of Mother's renown ham, roast beef, debris, and gravy.  The ""debris"" referred to the beef shreds that fell into the juices upon roasting.  The sandwich was an oozing mess of marinaded tender meats.  Each bite provided a mouthful of hearty, down-home flavor.

We went at around 7 on a Sunday night and the line was about 10 people outside the door plus a long line inside, but I'd say we got to the register within 20 minutes (maybe less) and had all of our food within another 10 minutes, so really not bad. We also didn't have trouble finding a table for the 5 of us. The atmosphere was fun/different and we enjoyed the brusqueness of the service - it was a different experience than back home for sure. 

Food was generally pretty good - the most disappointing was actually the ham. World's best - yeah, not so much. It was serviceable, but a little dry. The rice and beans were also only okay. We didn't notice much of a difference between the baked and fried ham. Catfish, roast beef and sausage po boys were great, sides of turnip greens and potato salad were also fantastic and the pepper vinegar on the tables had a great kick to it. Potato salad was really different for me coming from up north; we don't really have the ""mashed potato"" texture when we do our salads, but I really enjoyed it nonetheless. Bloody marys were also tasty. We wished we'd ordered more than one per person or there was an easier way to get another drink without waiting in the line all over again.

I'd say we were quite far down the block, but we were inside and eating within 25 minutes.  Once we were inside though, the line to order went quickly and the food came out almost as quickly as we sat down.  So we ordered our food, grabbed our drinks and then took the receipt and found a table.  The place is actually pretty huge inside.

So onto the food... the reason we're here.  We ordered a Ferdi Special and a sampler platter that had crawfish etoufee, shrimp and sausage jambalaya, red beans and rice, grits and potato salad.  I didn't think the Ferdi special was anything special, the wife liked it though.  The bread was a bit tough I thought and the bottom was completely soaked, so it was somewhat at extremes.  The meat inside wasn't too flavorful, so I didn't think it deserved all the attention it got.

As for the sampler platter, out of all of the items on this plate, the only thing that was flavorful was the jambalaya.  Now that, I could eat all day.  I kind of wish we had gotten a plate full of that instead.  The crawfish etoufee and red beans and rice were actually really lacking in flavor.  So I was pretty disappointed as it is one of my favorite dishes at the Creole joint we frequent up here in Chicago.

All in all, these two plates, two sodas ended up being $42.  Yikes!  quite pricey for lunch if you ask me, and there were no sides with the sandwich either.

This place haunts my dreams.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it, and that sucks, because it's very, very far away.

Ok, so, you gotta walk up-town if you're staying in the French Quarter, which trust me, is a blessing, because you need to burn this shit off, otherwise you'll die.  I mean it would take 4386460 walks from the FQ to uptown to burn this off, but the one walk helps.  We got to mother's and waited in line, which we were aware would happen.  Fine, you know what, we're on vacation.  A little line doesn't bother us.  We didn't have anywhere to go, and the best thing about new orleans is, you can drink on the street.  So, I walked down to the corner liquor store, got us two huge miller lights, brown bagged them, and we enjoyed those in line.

The line moved quickly, and before we knew it, we were presented with a very difficult question, what to order.  We thought about it and thought about it, and went with the cajun sample platter (crawfish etouffe, red beans and rice, jambalaya and a heap of potato salad), a fried chicken po boy, and dirty grits with cheese.  

Here it is, the statement of the review: THE BEST JAMBALAYA OF MY LIFE. I tasted everything else first, and was somewhat pleased, but then that jambalaya hit my mouth, and I knew the amount which was on the sample platter, which was ample, mind you, was not going to cut it.  So, I ordered another cup because I didnt want this jambalaya to stop coming.

The fried chicken po boy was incredible as well.  I dont know how they do it, but man, that thing is tasty!  The fried chicken was perfect, and the mix of lettuce and pickle and french bread really hits home.  So damn good. 

The rest of the meal was not nearly as exciting as the po boy and jambalaya, so if you want my opinion, stick to those.  However, the crawfish etoufee, if you're an etoufee fan, wont disappoint.

You must go here and get this jambalaya.  Dont forget the fried chicken po boy either.  And let me tell you, all this deliciousness washes down quite well with a brown bagged miller light.",2009-05-29 17:45:07,10.0,2175,10.0,0.024096385542168676,0.024096385542168676,0.21442250696755896,0.21442250696755896

This is the first place we went to after checking into our hotel - and it was within easy walking distance. Don't be turned off by the long lines that snake out the door. It goes fast. But that gives you plenty of time to look at the menu and decide what to order. You order at the cashier, find a table and roving servers bring out the food to you. 

Of course we had to try their famous debris Po boy. We chose the Ferdi Special - you can order the regular size or 2/3. The regular size is large enough for two. And the Gulf shrimp Po boy.  The Ferdi did not disappoint - the moist bread barely held the large amount of meat and debris. It's like having a roast beef sandwich on top of a ham sandwich, all dunked in gravy!  

We loved our server. We asked what he liked at Mother's and without hesitation, he said the bread pudding. A few minutes later, he brought out a free bowl of the bread pudding for us to try. And he was right!

I went onto Yelp to see what was recommended and ""shrimp poboy"" seemed to show up a lot. So I ordered that as well as a soft shell crab poboy and a side of turnip greens. The price for a regular-sized shrimp poboy WITHOUT a side is SIXTEEN DOLLARS. The soft shell crab poboy was TWENTY DOLLARS. How can you charge that much for a SANDWICH?

The poboy was NOT impressive and definitely not worth the price. The bread was rock hard and had the consistency of cardboard. There was way too much bread to shrimp/vegetable ratio. And speaking of ""vegetables,"" they only provided a small amount of tomatoes, pickles, and cabbage. Not even a slaw. Just plain dry cabbage. It was pretty bad. The soft shell crab was the same. Both seafood portions were disappointing. The poboys were so dry and hard to eat--I don't understand why so many people see the appeal. There wasn't even a side of cocktail sauce or tartar sauce.

Also, most people would probably like this, but the turnip greens had way too much meat, which probably contributed to it being way too salty.

Do not recommend. Definitely a tourist trap. The service was decent, but there was no one waiting on us and we had to clean up our own table before sitting down to eat... we also had to ask the security guard that stands at the entrance (and directs you/tells you to take a menu) for help as to where the silverware and napkins were.

My SO and I came here because we heard that their gumbo was really good. After ordering, for the next hour we proceeded to watch and realize that everyone else around us, including the people who ordered after us, were receiving their food, and we didn't even have anything on our table yet.

Confused, unhappy, and very hungry, we went to ask the waiters what was going on. Apparently they had sort of forgotten about us, and they were overall pretty bad at explaining what was going on that made it take so long to serve our food.

When we finally received our food, it was almost closing time, so we had to eat quickly. Although in other circumstances I'm sure that the gumbo would have been tasty enough, every taste felt bitter because of the poor service.

I had really high expectations but to be honest I was somewhat disappointed, especially because their food is slightly pricey considering it's just a sandwich. Now I'm not sure if there's a specific poboy that is recommended over another, but I ordered the calamari poboy. It tasted bland without the tartar sauce, but the bread was soft and easy to chew through. One of my friends did, however, order the grilled shrimp poboy and said that it was really flavorful and good! So maybe try that one if you come here.

It's the seafood platter.  The fried oysters, shrimp and tilapia were piled high on a plate.  It was crunchy, juicy and tender within the batter and addicting.  If you're unsure about it just ask if you can try a fried shrimp and you'll instantly be hooked, as in my situation.  There seemed to be a lot of locals here when we first came for lunch.  We walked in and wasn't sure if we needed to seated by someone, but after seeing people who came in after us walk up to the counter towards the end of the room, we realized that's where you order.  There are menus right by the door, which is why we thought someone would seat us, so it was a little confusing.  The menu is extensive and they have daily specials.  I wanted to try the Debris Po' Boy after hearing about it from the Travel Channel.  It's a roast beef sandwich on a baguette with mayo, mustard and shredded lettuce.  The au jus purposely soaks up the bottom bun and will run all over your plate and hands.  It's a messy one.  It's a good sandwich, but I didn't like it as much as the seafood here.  It's also very large, so the half size is good enough for one person.  We also had a side of red beans and rice, which was solid.

The ham was awful. I went a year ago.

I asked for a 3 element sandwich: ham, bread, butter. They refused. They ain't gonna do that. ""What?"" I asked humorously shocked. They ain't gonna do that. They wouldn't put the butter on the sandwich. Finally I got the over-priced-for-what-it-is ham sandwich. I put the butter on it from the little packet squares. Thankfully it was at least real butter.

I tried the Famous Ferdi Special and felt like it was so thick and dry. Everything from the meat inside to the bread, it just needed some moisture somewhere between all those layers of ingredients. One thing I did like was the oysters. Again, not the best, but an item I actually enjoyed at this place. It was crispy and the batter was satisfying and the large pieces of oysters was a plus. 

As for the sides, they were mediocre but there was one that did stand out. Nothing extraordinary about the potato salad or the grits. 

My favorite item had to be, hands down, the cabbage. The saltiness from bacon mixed with the cabbage was amazing. The cabbage seriously melted in your mouth but it still had a subtle crunch from the bacon and the cabbage. I would order a bowl of this and eat it with the fried oysters.

In a place where flavor is king, they have watered down the good Louisiana flavor to cater to the tourists from New Hampshire, Nebraska, and Minneapolis who cant handle a little lemon in their water. 
I poured on the crystal hot sauce and added as much taste as I could and it turned out to be a decent meal. 

One last thing I want to mention is that every employee in the joint was black except for one...the one handling the money. They must have had at least 20 people running around that place but the one waldo looking fool that was there was the only one allowed to touch one penny...a coincidence or just typical Louisiana racism?",2009-08-17 11:16:50,-1.0,1296,1.0,-0.004081632653061225,0.004081632653061225,-0.027777777777777776,0.027777777777777776

-The Po Boy's are huge here so don't over order... like I did...

Starting off, the line was ridiculously long. Luckily, they were able to give us menus outside, so once we were in we knew what to order. It took approximately 30-40 minutes for us to order, along with another 15 to get our food. I ordered Mae File's Gumbo, and it was absolutely delicious. Amazing in fact, and loved that it was given with a slice of toasted french bread. The gumbo wasn't too spicy and had amazing flavor. It just had a blend of all the right spices for my taste. For this, I give the food 5 stars.

Service on the other hand was something else. One, was as I already mentioned, was the line. Considering how long the line was, they could have definitely worked faster. Inside the restaurant it is RIDICULOUSLY crowded, and the employees are always running by you bringing stuff in and out of the kitchen, and they are very rude if you're in their way. There's not enough seats for big groups if you come in on certain nights (we were there on a Friday), so you're forced to take your food to go.

I understand that working at this restaurant can be stressful considering the amount of clientele they get, but customer service is always key for me.

Armed with a great recommendation from a friend who went to Tulane, we checked out Mother's to try their famous sandwiches with ""debris""

How this restaurant works is you wait in line (it seems like most of the line ends up being outside) until you get to the counter inside.  You place your order and then they make your sandwich and you walk down to the end to pay and get your beverage.  Then you find yourself a seat and they bring you your food.  This is a super-casual place.  But don't let that discourage you- the food is banging.

I tried the ""Ferdi"" special, which is ham, roast beef, debris (which is a thick gravy made of bits of roast beef) and gravy.  They top it with pickles, cabbage, mayo and mustard.  The two sizes are full or 2/3 portion.  I suggest getting the 2/3 and splitting it with a friend.  Because these sandwiches are MASSIVE.

Be aware this is not in the French Quarter but it is a short walk or taxi ride away.

Unfortunately, I don't think it was worth it....I got the Jambalaya platter with grits and red beans and rice. The Jambalaya was amazing and perfect for someone that doesn't like seafood, since it was just chicken and sausage. The red beans and the grits on the other hand were seriously lacking though. I mean, nobody should feel the need to add salt to any food in NOLA, seriously. Especially the red beans and rice, absolutely no flavor!!!!! And I am a red beans and rice connoisseur!

He was so kind and gave me and my significant other (which sounds silly because I want to caller her my girlfriend but she's so much more than a girl-friend, its almost demeaning to call her that but I can't call her my wife because we're not married, nor fiance and ""my woman or my lady"" sounds like caveman-ish.. Like I'm Ike Turner or someone born in the age where womebn were called ""broads"". I digress...) er... my spouse so many kind words.  I'm gonna come back just because he said we made his day enjoyable after not such a good start for him. 

Backstory: My spouse and I made a quick day trip to the NOLA for my birthday. I loved the way teh air smells... thick sea smell mixed with cajun spices. Yum. 

So we go out to do our thing, see a musuem but we got rained on so much we had to go back to the hotel which turned into a spontaneous ""let's go get tatoos"" moment. Mind you I never had a tatoo and opted for a leg piece that took 2+ hours of razorblade digging in to my virgin flesh. So it was getting late and my lady.. (yeesh) was getting mighty hungry. Now if you know women then you know the hungrier they are the more likely you'll end up in an argument over something really small, so as soon as the ink was done, we took a Lyft to Mother's, stopping briefly at a New Orleans Daqueri drive thru for this drink that was so strong I want to bring up it's banning at a city council meeting. A drive thru? Really?? Anyway we get to Mothers the line was like 10 deep, not so bad and we order. It takes a second and because you haveto wait on this line that goes past all of the food being cooked and served you get insanely more hungry. So we wait...and wait...and wait until they serve us all this glorious food!!!  

The Shrimp and Oyster Po Boy, the sampler and some gosh danged good GRITS. No-nonsense eating here. We could of ate this on the floor its so damned good. Anyone that gave Mothers anything less than a 4 star rating is a soulles coward. Who cares if it was a hair in the gumbo, suck that staind clean bro. A bug in the grits? stop being a nancy and get that extra protien!  Dont waste any gravy!! LOL. 

Seriously Mr Marvin may of been just saying that we brightened his day because that's his job but he did give my woman (SMH) a tub of Banana Pudding so that makes him an angel in our book. 

We were supposed to hit the Quarter for Hand Grenades and all that tourist stuff but we were happy and full with a flight to catch in the AM so we passed out in all of our clothes, woke up for our flights and ate teh leftovers.

We also had the Gumbo which was like from a can. Wait, let me refrase that, some can soups are much better. Besides the bland and tasteless food, the prices are just crazy.

Mother's is located in a historic building that is (conveniently) across the street from the W Hotel on Poydras.  Your going to wait in a line, probably outside in the heat, no matter what time of day you go - so just prepare yourself.  We managed, so will you.  As soon as you get inside, start checking the menu so you are ready to order.  Because once you get near the counter the action begins and everything moves fast.

Everything on the Mother's breakfast menu is done just right.  I recommend Ham & Cheese, with a homemade biscuit & some southern grits.  Then add a cup of red beans & rice or jambalaya on side - you don't want to leave without trying it.

Aside from the great food, the restaurant and staff are totally are worth the trip. Their system for delivering your food is one I've never experienced anywhere else.  You order at counter and when you pay they write something the copy of the receipt they keep.  Then you find your own table from an array of rooms.  Then you wait a little bit.  When they serve your food, you'll see the description (of you) they wrote on your receipt at the counter.  Our group had ""blue shirt"", ""stripes"" and ""moustache"".  The servers just weave through the restaurant until they find someone matching the description on the receipt.  Not the most efficient system, but seemed to perfectly fit New Orleans - and it added a humorous element to the experience.

Best time to try Mother's: breakfast, brunch or early lunch. It will cure even the meanest New Orleans hangover.",2010-07-13 03:31:10,25.0,1714,25.0,0.07911392405063292,0.07911392405063292,0.6038576879954624,0.6038576879954624

With that kind of recommendation, how could I really refuse right? So my FIRST night in New Orleans, that was where I headed.  Very simple set up, almost like a cafeteria in which you walk up this line to order your food and pay.  You go to a table of your choice and they bring the food to you as you take a number.  

What do I order in the South? Um, a salad? Nope! I go for the fried chicken! Come on! I like the dark meat myself, so that's what I got.  My friend read on the sign that they are known for ham so she ordered that.  We sat down and casually chatted and planned on where we needed to go and what we had to see in NOLA.

The tables around us included people from other conferences too, tables of 10 or so people all enjoying the food.  No complains really.  So here comes our food and what did I think? The chicken was nice and tasty, good flavor with a good crunch.  I asked for potato salad and macaroni and cheese on the side.  Potato salad, personally I like a little sour kick to it, not really a fan of the sweetness of it that some places opt for.  Here, it was nice and tasty, enough mayonnaise and not sweet.  That was good.  The macaroni and cheese was creamy and the pasta was just right.  My friend enjoyed her ham and also got a side of raspberry jam with her biscuit just because.  That jam is AWESOME! Deliciously sweet and tasty.  A great find.  We were stuffed from dinner that we skipped dessert.

So we wake up the next morning and opt for breakfast but where? We came back less than 24 hours later for breakfast.  I got a shrimp creole omelet with grits and a biscuit.  I honestly didn't care for it.  It was like they put the shrimp creole ingredients into the omelet after it was cooked.  It just felt like an after thought.  I only tried it because I was in the South and figured I have tried other types of breakfast combinations elsewhere.  And I had grits for the first time.  I'm from the West, so um, just not my thing.  Just a bland pile of grains.  I added a little salt alone, it was OK.  I tried it with butter too and it was OK.  I think I like a little sugar because it gives it a little flavor, but not a breakfast item I can't live without.  My friends and I were so loud that we may have embarrassed a small group of elderly people to the point that they changed tables.  Oh well, I apologize to them, but we were having fun!

So all in all, I WILL come back for dinner and lunch, but breakfast was just OK to me.  I think if I get breakfast, I will go for the standard items, not a shrimp creole omelet.  Just a standard eggs and bacon and I'm good.  Enjoy! If you come at the odd hours, you have better luck getting in.  We had a late dinner, around 8:30 or so so I was able to avoid the long lines.

The decor inside isn't anything to celebrate.

There's also a bar in this room so I imagine you can rent this space out for private parties.

When you order  a Debris Po'Boy, dressed, you'd expect to at least get a Po'Boy in some shape or form. We didn't. The way they serve there's no chance to validate the receipt because they take it.

The food is just plain bad. In our first attempt, the food we did get was a loveless, assembly-line scoop of flavorless goop. My wife's gumbo had all the life of a sausage skin. My red beans and rice were pretty the much the paltry same. 

I was here for the Po'Boy. So determined was I that I got back in line and did the same slow crawl back to the front of the counter that you can expect to suffer here. Only I was foolish enough to suffer twice. 

When I did get my 'dressed' Po'Boy, it was laughable. if by dressed they mean a 3 specks of cabbage then dressed it was but lame is what I got. Another flavorless pile of goop on a soggy bun.

I do appreciate the effort and hard work of the staff busking tables. But the lack of care behind the counter means its all for naught. The owners are obviously content to phone it in and rest on their laurels, but they're dialing the wrong number. 

The atmosphere is divy but interesting. It is clean. As a highlight, you can count on experiencing mild pandemonium while you're here. Unless you're a regular, plan on getting disoriented. That in a way makes the experience entertaining. Once you've ordered and found your seat, you'll have plenty of time to watch the confusion while you wait for the lifeless goop to arrive.

Mother's is supposed to be a throwback to the grubby diners where all the celebs make a pit stop on their way through town. Judging by the plethora of photos tacked on the wall, that rite of passage ended sometime in the early 2000's. And I can see why. The lines were long, the prices high and the food was just abysmal.

That's how good it is.

In a city with 100s of good restaurants, we've been known to dine at Mother's once a day for four or five days in a row.

During a recent visit, we braved driving, sideways rain and a tornado watch to make it to the corner of Poydras and Tchoupitoulas for ham, biscuits and a Ferdi.

Mother's has been around since 1938.


Though many know it for its stalwart breakfasts -- served all day -- Mother's serves some of the best lunch and dinner comfort food in Louisiana.

What's a Ferdi?

A Ferdi is the best of all worlds:  Mother's famous baked ham on top of roast beef on top of debris -- the super well done juicy drippings of the roast -- on top of a huge po boy bun.

You can get it dressed with lettuce, tomato, yellow and creole mustard.

But we prefer to get it as is -- why would you want veggies and mustards to get in the way of all that meaty goodness?

The biscuits are huge and come stuffed with egg and meat if you chose them.

The meat is three kinds of ham -- baked, fried and Mother's delicacy: black ham...those sweet, crispy, intense end pieces.

Omelet was fine, average diner omelet. The ham in the omelet was very good, to be honest. The biscuit was an average, fresh, homemade biscuit.

The famous ferdi sandwich was tasty, though not the best Po Boy (ahem, Parasol's) that we tried in NO. It was supposed to come with debris (we were very excited about the prospect of this) however I thought this might mean there was more gravy involved- it seemed a little dry.

Went all out and got some bread pudding too- one of the tastiest desserts! It came warm and delectable moist, stuffed with fruit pieces and bathed in caramel-butterscotch sauce.

We showed up around 8:30pm and waited less than 10m outside. The line inside took longer, maybe 15m. We get to the cashier, pay for our food and drink, and then we don't know what we are supposed to do. We sit in the back room, the waiter come and pick our ticket and drop it at the kitchen. After waiving him he told us we have to get our drinks upfront. An other line, shorter, the drinks lady was not there when we paid but the cashier should have told us to wait for her.

We wait probably 20m+ for the food to arrive. In the mean time the table next to us waive a waiter about their fried chicken, which let to some argument between him, the waiter assigned to the table, and the restaurant manager. Not very professional to argue in front of the customer. The couple that was before us was still waiting for their order when we left: they ordered fried chicken. It looks like the fried chicken is only cooked on order, but hen only when the waiter bring the order to the kitchen and for the kitchen to pick it up. I recommend the manager to have the cashier to trigger the fried chicken right away when it is paid for. This would cut at least 15m to the customer wait. Also since their are always fried chicken orders and that it takes so long, I don't know why they can't have some chickens in the frier at all times. Just to make sure the waits won't be so long.

One if the waiters from the front room was throwing dirty dishes in a bucket near us and that was really loud and annoying.

Now we did get our food and we cannot complain about our waiter, he was prompt when called and looked professional. I can't say as much from the other waiter, looked like there was some tension between them. Most of what we order only needed playing (gumbo, soup, √©touff√©e, sausages) the only thing done to order was the fried seafood. It should really not take that long.

The food was tasty and plentiful, but not outstanding. The staff could be a little more professional in general (keep arguments away from the customers), make less noise when clearing plates, and improve the soft drinks issue (why a line for that).

If they can improve the time to plate and serve the turnaround will be faster and the wait lines shorter...

We went here for lunch not really knowing what to expect, and we did arrive before 11:30 before the locals began to pile in for lunch. Just a tip to avoid long lines--go early or go late for lunch, but avoid the noon hour. Now, I will also say everyone was very friendly. We didn't know what to order, but the regulars steered us to the combination plate. It was outstanding. We had jambalaya, red beans and rice, out-of-this world potato salad and turnip greens.

My complaint sadly was the gumbo.  It seemed more like a canned soup gumbo.  Instead of the nice dark flavorful and spicy gumbo where you get to experience the seafood stock layered with a lot of heat I was met with very bland gumbo that I kept hitting with salt and Tabasco sauce in the hopes of kicking it up, only to try eating a cup of tasteless but salty Tabasco slop.  Everything else about my experience was wonderful but honestly I'd rather a local staple like seafood gumbo not even be on the menu if it is going to be like this.

Established in 1938, Mother's survived not only hurricanes Katrina and Rita, but they survived Camile as well. Mother's was the first restaurant to introduce the hero/grinder/sub sandwich to south. Their name for it... the Po-Boy. 

The tour books and some of the reviews I feel don't do the place justice. They have hosted almost every celebrity that has ever visited the city and they have a special place in the hearts for cops, firefighters and military personnel. Parking is tough but they are easily reached by bus or street car, within a few block of the riverfront and the western edge of the French Quarter. 

While in NOLA for 7 days, I went there 3 times and got the famous Po-Boy sandwiches , with a variety of sides. I've had their famous ham, the Turkey and those in my parties had the gumbo, slaw and fries on the side. Everything, including the fries, are made by hand and are fabulous. They also put stuff in to a Po-Boy that I've never thought to have... shrimp for instance was an interesting filler. They offer a variety of PB's as cold or hot sandwiches was as great as well.

The dessert menu is limited but they do have some items. Their pecan pie is similar to some of the ladies who work there, big and sweet. We order the PP and found that it may even be too sweet if you were to eat a piece all by yourself. 

Seating is OK, most tables are two and four person with one or two big enough for 6 but they don't mind if you pull tables together. They do get busy but are really busy on the weekends. Tourist go there alot but during the work week, its filled with locals too especially at lunch time. My three times there, I waited 5 minutes to order, 20 minutes, and 2 minutes. It all depends on week vs. weekend and time of day. Parking is on the street and adjacent private lots. Best bet is to just take the bus or street cars and walk a few blocks. 

Portion sizes are good, bordering on huge but everything is fresh. If you want a great food experience in NOLA, you can't go wrong by popping into Mother's.",2010-10-15 21:27:33,35.0,2127,35.0,0.08771929824561403,0.08771929824561403,0.7588995571528109,0.7588995571528109

I spent 5 days in New Orleans with my boyfriend on a foodscapade. That said, we saw a lot of food spots and ate a LOT of food. Of all the places we hit on our list, I have to say Mother's was my favorite. I believe this spot is a true NOLA experience. 

Don't expect ambiance, unless you're seeking authentic mom and pop interior of a city staple, which I was. It's a wait in line-spit your order at the counter girl-grab your ticket kind of place where you pay at the end of the line. Think popular ice cream parlor. After we paid we found a table near a wall touted with signed photos of celebrities at Mother's. 

We came here after a Saint's game where we already munched and imbibed, so we decided to split the crawfish etouffee combo plate. Each combo plate comes with red beans and rice and jambalaya. After seeing their outdoor sign underlined with ""World's best baked ham"" I was nicely surprised to find out their red beans and rice is dotted with it! We chose potato salad and turnip greens as our side to balance out the dish. 

Every single component of this dish was perfect and exactly what we were looking for in that moment. Comforting, savory,
rich Nawlins cuisine. Best red beans and rice I've ever had, and the etouffee... Ugh! Seafood was cooked perfectly and drenched in their delicious sauce. You can tell this restaurant can whip up their perfected menu in their sleep. I would return to New Orleans just for this place!

On our first free day after Essence Fest and a wedding, we awoke at noon and walked from our hotel over to Mother's -- arriving in the line at approximately 2:30 pm.  let's just say that 15 minutes later I was willing to contribute toward the awning fund at Mother's in order to save myself the effort of wiping the sweat off that was rolling down the middle of my back into my panties.  30 minutes later we were allowed inside only to be greeted by another line with an approximately 45 minute wait.  At this point, we are committed.

My first warning sign was the rude hostess who told me that I could not sit down in an empty chair next to the line until I paid for my food.  When I explained that I am partially disabled and cannot stand for long periods of time, I was told I could sit in a high barstool along the side wall.  Little irritated with that.

Arrive at the food counter to observe women with long weaves dippin into the food, no gloves on and plates stacking high in the busperson's bins in great need of attention.  But we were committed.  Food looked good - especially the cobbler.  

Get to the end of the counter to order - no fried chicken.  How does a Southern restaurant named Mother's run out of fried chicken?  No ice.  Okay.  We are committed.  Ordered red beans & rice, ham (world's best according to the sign), crawfish etouffee, catfish po'boy and the cobbler.

Lots of choices for tables so why the line we ask ourselves?  Take a seat in the back where it is cooler -- wait for our food while overhearing a loud drunk from the bar next door.  Food arrives and the waitress spills some red beans on my new Coach handbag.  Since it is food and I am starving with a hangover, I'm not too upset until I taste the food.  Where is the seasoning?  Red beans and rice needs some Lawry's.  Cabbage is good.  Ham is cold.  Who serves cold ham with a hot plate of food?  Crawfish etouffee is outstanding and the husband wishes he would have ordered a bowl instead of a cup.  The catfish po'boy came on stale bread.  Would not order again.  Okay, where is my cobbler?

It also gives you the time to take in the ""New Orleans charm."" It was very old fashioned style on the inside.

This place serves up many cajun/creole favorites: po boys, jambalaya, crawfish etouffee, and many other items like breakfast foods, meats, fried chicken and desserts.

Normally you pay for your food and wait for them to bring it to you, but unfortunately we had to order to-go. WARNING: If you order fried food expect to WAIT! They even warn you on the menu if you order chicken it's a 20 minute wait.

My boyfriend unfortunately decided to order the seafood platter with two sides. $22 for a seafood platter? I know plenty of places that will have it for way less. I didn't get to eat any but from what I saw he has oysters, shrimp and catfish. This decision made us wait for 20 minutes for everything to fry up. Plus we were crammed by the exit by the register, by some very suspicious standing water.

I on the other hand had crawfish etouffee. I'm used to a creamier homemade etouffee, but this one was delicious. Even though it as probably frozen crawfish tails, it was very meaty and flavorful. The sides however were not that great. The potato salad was just how I liked, with just mayo mustard and eggs, but it was warm from being on the steam table. No one likes warm potato salad, at least me anyway. Plus the ""grits with butter"" was very bland and not buttery at all.

I ordered the (Jerry's) Jambalaya and the Original (Ferdi's Famous Special) Po-Boy.  The Jambalaya was out of this world and to date I have not found anything other jambalaya like it.  The dish was flavorful and when I added Mother's special hot sauce (it looked to be their own creation as the bottle had no label on it), it added a light kick to it that ramped up the flavor.  Because I had such a flavorful dish first, when I got to trying the Po'boy, it couldn't compare.  
My dinner companion, however, had the Po'boy first and said it was the best po'boy he had on our trip.  He had the jambalaya too and was blown away by that dish as well.  

We were both so stuffed that we couldn't order anything more, which is too bad because I would've liked to have tried their desserts and the red beans & rice.  Everything that other customers ordered looked mighty good.

A New Orleans staple...one of the places you have to eat at only to be able to say you've eaten there.  Unfortunately, that's largely the only reason to come to Mother's.  The rest of the food is just...meh.

Their famous po' boy (the Ferdi special) is just bread some meat, coleslaw, and some mustard.  Nothing spectacular about it.  The sandwich falls apart in your hands from all the au jus (yet, some people might consider this a good thing).  The taste, though, was the ""meh"" part.

The service, though, IS spectacular.  You get taken care of from the moment you sit down.  That's only after you sit down, though.  The first part, when you walk into this place, you almost feel like an army recruit.  The host and/or hostess just yelling out,  ""Single file line.  Against the wall.""  Not very welcoming.  But it gets better once you get your food.

There looks to be a lot of other dishes available at Mother's but I decided to go with their most famous dish.  It didn't do it for me, but maybe their other dishes will satisfy your cravings.

I got a cup of the chicken & sausage gumbo, a ""ferdi"" sandwich, and some bread pudding. Let me go in order. 

The gumbo was fine. Not spectacular but tasty. Adding some hot sauce definitely improved it. I would not be opposed to having it again. 

The roast beef ferdi was fantastic. I start on the sandwich and it's made with a sturdy roll but there's not much on the inside. Then I make the connection - I'm supposed to be adding the ""debris"". What is debris? It's like shredded beef in jus. For lack of a better description, it's like a French dip, but the dip is filled with beef. Definitely worth ordering again. 

Then I decide to break into the bread pudding. It's one of my favorite desserts and I have had a number of different styles. (When motivated, I make a pretty good bread pudding too.) The Mothers version was more like bread stew...in a good way. Remember the sturdy sandwich rolls? I presume that's what they're using for the pudding, and with good reason. They stand up well in the tasty broth. Add some fruit and we have a winner. It has made me reconsider how I make my own pudding. 

Overall a solid outing. I would be happy to eat here again.",2014-11-17 00:19:12,36.0,1393,36.0,0.13688212927756654,0.13688212927756654,0.9645548798776379,0.9645548798776379

Now, on to my review. I spotted a line outside of Mother's while taking a taxi to the Hilton on a Saturday evening. July 13th specifically. Any place with a line outside has to be good right? Right?!

I convinced my family of 7 to take a stroll to the restaurant. A uniformed security person gives you the run down while you are in line outside, you order, get your drinks, go sit at your table and wait for your food to arrive. Simple enough. We ordered a variety of items; fried chicken, gumbo, crawfish etouffee, crabs, red beans and rice, bread pudding...what a feast! If only we actually got to eat any of it. We were told the chicken would take 30 to 40 minutes, fresh to order. No problem! The rest of our order would arrive as it was plated. The time was approximately 7;15PM. 

We sat with our drinks and were ushered to a back room decorated in the fashion of a storage space in a slaughter house, complete with an iron sliding door..We then began our wait. We approached a server who took pity on us and gave us some bread for the children at the 40 minute mark. At 45 min, the etouffee arrived for one person. The children got so hungry at 1 hour that I approached the window where meals seemed to pour out for diners. They were working on our order, the chicken takes time we were told. And hour and a half later my 8 year old was taken back to the hotel.  Still no chicken.  At  9:15pm the chicken arrived with cold, soft shell crab. Upon complaining to one of the two managers on staff he asked ""What do you expect me to do?"". ***Note to management; when customers complain about a 2+ hours wait the FIRST thing that should come out of your mouth is SORRY. SORRY, it goes a long way. No, we never heard sorry, he refused to take any amount off of my bill. So, since the child who ordered the chicken, fries and bread pudding wasn't there, I handed the untouched food  back to him, plate by plate, still steaming after a 2 hour wait. I was refunded the meal I handed back without so much as a Dog kiss my foot..ah well, my money is best spent elsewhere.

When I figure out how to post a picture of my receipt it will follow shortly.

You stand outside in line, to go INSIDE, to a line to order.  THEN after you place the order, you sit at any table, and a server comes and retrieves the food. The line moves pretty quick once you understand the system. You'll be expected to look at the menu in line and be ready to order (soup-nazi-type style) when you get to the front of the line.

We stuck with the Ferdi Regular.  And the 2/3rd which is ridiculously big.

I have to say I was a bit disappointed. Despite asking for it to come without mayo, it came with mayo.  And the bread became really soggy from all the sauce, which made it difficult to eat and a little blech.

The meat itself with the pickles and cabbage were quite good, but the overall presentation just left a lot to be desired.  Price is high for the atmosphere.

The food and service were average with their signature cafeteria/diner style manner of service with a classic vibe. The line and wait for dinner‚Äã at around 5pm was not too bad, but was to be expected based on other reviews and the general tourist appeal. In fact it seems the long lines and vintage look are what pull in the tourists. If people are waiting in that long line for food, then it must be good, right? 

I ordered the combination platter to get a sampling of a little of everything at Mother's. The generously sized platter included jambalaya, red beans and rice, potato‚Äã salad, crawfish etouffee (or shrimp), and choice of one side (turnip greens). The jambalaya was tasty and on the sweeter side, but I prefer spicy. The red beans and rice were very bland and the sausage was lacking in texture/flavor, so it ended up being my least favorite. The potato salad might have been my favorite and was a welcomed surprise to try the mashed-style potato salad. I have never had crawfish etouffee before so it is hard to compare, but I enjoyed it and it was my second favorite item. The turnip greens were not too bad and had delicious chunks of ham in them. All of the food items seemed to lack in spice and were under-seasoned, but this was overwhelmingly overcorrected for by being a salt bomb to the face. 

Their location is very central to a lot of the major hotels and the casino, which makes it prime real estate. It looks vintage, which it is, but also was a little dirty. The wait staff and the experience were nice, and I enjoyed my first visit.

However, I do understand that Mother's is an institution in New Orleans, so its worth trying once, but come in with low expectations. If you must try Mother's, you can call in your order beforehand if they're not busy, but you'll have to wait in line to order your food to go if they are. For me, this was one of the most disappointing/underwhelming meals I had in New Orleans, and the only dish worth coming back for is the jambalaya. The poboy and bread pudding were solid, but not amazing. My coworker and I started standing in line around 5pm, and it was less than a half hour wait at that time (the line at least moves fairly quickly). We ended up trying:

-Famous Ferdi's Special (Ham & Roast Beef, Original Debris, Au Jus Gravy, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Zs0G4xzx4oDUwm3JpxL6KQ&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Not very good- the ham and roast beef were both dry and salty, and the debris/au jus gravy did not improve the sandwich. The bread was also very dry. I would not order this sandwich again.
-Red Beans & Rice (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=c8MA2blwHTra3JUFayPe-w&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Pretty flavorful, but not amazing. I wouldn't get this again.
-Fried Shrimp & Oyster Poboy (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=AxbjgMVXPUnvVP3JuLqYmg&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Yum- the shrimp and oyster were fried perfectly, and the tartar/remoulade sauce was really good. I tried asking for more since they didn't put much on the sandwich, but they never brought it by, which was really disappointing. I would recommend this poboy though!
-Seafood Gumbo (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=34VQFuEcy2SnoTaKDitPXw&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Good, but nothing special. The gumbo at Luke's is way, way better.
-Jambalaya (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=F2kaBpxnenurLqf0ChjOwg&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): One of the better dishes we had here- the jambalaya was very flavorful, and chock full of sausage. Recommended!
-Bread Pudding (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=bEec_rTIRYS1lf3oRk2YXg&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Solid bread pudding, but we wished they served this with whipped cream or ice cream. Still recommended if you love bread pudding.

I want to preface this review by saying I rarely like to leave bad reviews on restaurants I've only eaten at one time.  Every restaurant can have a bad day. However, after talking to some friends and reading some of the reviews online, I feel like my complaints are more a regular thing than an anomaly.

Being a Monday morning, I wasn't expecting there to be a line, but there was. I'm okay with that. We waited 2.5 hours in Denver at a place called Snooze, but the food and the service made me forget the wait. I can wait for a good dining experience. 

So a 45 min wait in the cold wasn't that bad. However, when we walked into the place, we were immediately yelled at by a rude kitchen worker for standing in the wrong place. I had to bite my tongue because she was going to be touching my food, and we had been waiting way too long to get kicked out 5 feet from the register. 

When we got to the register, the worker was impatient and didn't give us anytime to ask questions about the menu.  Her attitude was as if we were bothering her by asking questions.  The girl serving the drinks had an expression on her face like she would rather be doing anything else other than what she was doing. My girlfriend was so rushed that she ended up settling for something she wasn't really excited about ordering. 

Having said all of that, I am a very patient and forgiving person. I can put up with all of that if the food is to die for. But sadly, it wasn't. I got the red beans with a side of cabbage and collard greens. The food was very bland. I had to cover it in salt and pepper and hot sauce to allow me to enjoy it. Their ""famous"" ham, wasn't even in the top 10 of baked ham I've had in south Louisiana.  

My girlfriend's jambalaya was just not very good either. Maybe I've been spoiled by really good Cajun food, growing up here. And maybe tourists from out of town would enjoy this because they don't know any better. But for someone who enjoys good food coupled with a good dining experience, this was just one big disappointment. It was such a bad experience that I was tempted to tell everyone in line to not waste their time and go somewhere else. 

There was a sign on the wall that said no tipping. And that probably sums up the root of the problem. The workers are likely underpaid and under appreciated. I would rather leave a big fat tip and enjoy my experience than not have to tip and suffer through such a lack luster eating experience. 

Will probably never return to eat here.",2013-12-31 17:57:02,7.0,2641,7.0,0.013888888888888888,0.013888888888888888,0.13621152003439177,0.13621152003439177

here it goes ..we were going for a late lunch 1:30pm.  i called the restuarant to see if they took reservations.  kind lady on the phone says no and explains the way the restuarant is set up. arrive, order food at counter, then find a table and wait for food.  She also told me that there is always a line but around this time it might be 20 - 30 minutes.

this isnt my first rodeo and ive been known to wait a little bit for some tasty treats...so no big deal, right? WRONG - ive never waited in line under the beating sun in 90 degree weather and 80% humidity.  i thought i was going to pass out.  why was there no awning? why was there no cool water mister? why was there someone coming thru with cups of cold water? Im just saying ....the wait under these conditions could be hazardous to your health.  when we got closer to the front of the line, there were a couple of menus being passed around ...I just used it as a fan and cover for my head.  

We finally made it in 20 minutes later (felt like an hr in the heat) stood in another line, ordered our food (soft shell crab, shrimp creole, gumbo).  we waited for 45 minutes before our food arrived.  when it arrived, we all felt our food could have used more seasoning.  

perhaps it was the sweltering heat...perhaps it was the extreamly long line and long wait time for our food but we were not really impressed.

We had not planned on going there and hadn't done much research on what we should order and how the setup works.  Fortunately when we got there at 12:30 on a Thursday there was only a line inside and not outside.  That didn't give us a lot of time with the menu so I felt a little bit of self-inflicted pressure reminiscent of ordering from the Soup Nazi. :) 
It was not necessary though, the woman at the register was very patient with me while I asked about debris (how have I never heard of this before, it's the best part of the roast beef!). I ordered the roast beef po'boy, which is sliced roast beef topped with debris and also comes with mustard and lettuce.  I wanted to order what they are most known for, but if there is a next time, my order will just be a debris po' boy, I didn't love the sliced roast beef as much.  My husband had the Ferdi special and enjoyed it, but I think we were both a little thrown by the mustard and lettuce.  It's not the normal condiment either of us would choose but we wanted to have it they way they serve it because they know best.  
We also ordered a cup of seafood etouffe and a cup of shrimp gumbo.  The Gumbo was the best cup I had in NOLA, including the one at Commander's Palace, which was excellent. But this one, the seafood flavor was so deep and the roux so flavorful.  I couldn't get enough of it. The etouffe was good but the gumbo was stand out. Loved it. 
We had a slice of pecan pie and a brownie for dessert. Our 4 year old had a grilled cheese sandwich and french fries which she ate all of, so there is a success!

I ordered breakfast food (eggs and pancakes) and thought it was ok, but I honestly prefer Denny's better.

Friend and I were struggling through our hangovers in desperate need of something to eat. Since Mother's was just a close few blocks from our hotel with a ton of highly positive reviews, we decided to make the trek over for something to fill our bellies.

Ordering is intimidating to say the least. Since it was later in the afternoon, the line wasn't as daunting as others have made it out to be. Definitely pick up a menu and have what you want in mind before getting to the cash register, because like others have said the line moves quick and the cashiers operate like a well oiled machine. Stuttering and hemming and hawing about is frowned upon. We ordered, paid, and got our drinks.

Finding a place to sit can be confusing. As a heads up, take your receipt with you and choose a table. A server in your section will take your receipt to retrieve your order. By a stroke of luck, we happened to sit in the section with the grumpiest server ever. Everyone has their bad days, I guess.

We got our order of fries, bowl of gumbo, and shrimp po boy quickly. Initially we had come craving for fried chicken, but were put off by the 30 min wait. Looking back, we probably should have just sucked it up and waited. 

The fries were just what we needed--greasy enough to soak up all the alcohol in our systems, but they were also just very typical. The gumbo was served with generous bites of seafood included which made the $8 price tag. I wish that it was served at a temperature hotter than just warm, though. My friend's shrimp po boy was huge in size, and from what he said it was pretty tasty but nothing to shout about. 

Overall, decent food, but nothing particularly special to be found here especially considering some of the prices of the items on the menu.

First, get there way before or after lunch time, otherwise you will be waiting on a line down the block. Not fun. 

Second, it's a little confusing, but basically, you are on a line, you order your food and drinks, seat yourself (taking your drink with you), then give your receipt to a server, and the server comes back bringing your food to you. Guess it works for them.

What's a po'boy to me? A sandwich type food from New Orleans on a white sub loaf with lettuce and some type of meat (catfish, oysters, meat). Preferable for me over muffulettas (another type of New Orleans sandwich). 

Ferdi special po'boy- A must try since it's their iconic sandwich. I love Debris. It's that beefy dripping looking stuff drizzled on your po'poy.

Roast beef po'boy- If you like roast beef and meat, you'll like this. Roast beef and debris. Yum. For me, I love meat in sauce, so I like the messy all Debris po'boy.

Catfish po'boy- Not the best in this town, but good.

Crawfish √©touff√©e - Comes on white rice with a side. Great for the $ here. A favorite. I like turnip greens (hard to find veggies in this town!).

This is how it works:
You walk in, they give you a menu.
You line up by the counters, deciding what you want to order.
You place you order with the cashier, and pay.
Drinks are picked up to the right of the cashier.
You find your seats, with your receipt in hand.
A waiter/waitress will come by, and take your receipt, listing your order.
You wait 20-30 minutes for your food.

So now that you are fully aware of the process, here is what we ordered (for four people):
Jambalaya, large
Gumbo, large
Oyster, soft shell crab and fried shrimp po boy

THE BAD:  The reason for the 3 stars would have to go straight to the jambalaya.  None of us liked it; in fact, we all had one bite and pushed it aside.  It was sour (ketchupy) and that was the only taste you got from it.  Oh, it had good sausage.  That's ALL it had going for it.  (Good thing we decided to give jambalaya another try at another place or else this would've ruined us forever).  The oyster po boy was also ehhh... the oysters just didn't taste fresh and was very seafoody, which makes me gag.

THE GOOD:  The shrimp po boy was really good.  Really, really good.  Shrimp was fresh and plentiful.  Same goes for the soft shell crab po boy.  I would definitely recommend these.  The gumbo was also good, but seemed quite watered down.  I had HEARD there was a shrimp... ONE SHRIMP in someone's bowl.  Obviously not mine.  No one else had a shrimp :(

Each day we'd see lines of 20-30 people outside of Mother's.  I guess it's a good experience for NOLA, but definitely not the definition of NOLA food.

It reminded me of a high school cafeteria buffet line. That wasn't the worst part. A young lady was leaning over the food and as she was preparing a customers plate she coughed over all of the food that she was hovering over. She looked up at me and must have read the disgust on my face because she rolled her eyes and yelled out, ""ain't nobody got time for that"". After the coughing situation I was more than ready to about-face and walk out the door but my friend urged me to open minded, after-all we were visiting and she did not want this to ruin my experience. We get to the front of the line to order our food and the young woman taking the order was extremely rude. She rushed us as we ordered and she did not even get our order right. I wanted crawfish ettoufee and nothing else but she charged by for an entire seafood platter.

Grab a menu and get in line. They take your order and payment at the counter and then you go find a table. One of the gentlemen running food will come get your receipt and bring your food out when it's ready. 

I had a Ferdi special poboy, which was very delicious! It has a couple different meats on it and debris gravy. My friends had seafood poboys and everyone seemed happy. The veggie (cheese) poboy needs some sprucing up (better cheese, and maybe add some avocado or sprouts or something instead of just American cheese).

She helped round out the experience to make it one we will remember.

Chicken Gumbo - Not the best we have had in Nola but still very good and worth recommending.
Shrimp Creole with fries and grits - nothing to write home about.  Would recommend ordering something else. 
Bloody Mary - Solid, traditional, tasty
Bread pudding - Fabulous! 

In hind sight maybe we should have ordered a poboy since this is what they are known for. I would definitely come back again for the bread pudding and the chicken gumbo.

Food: 3-4 stars depending on what you get
Price:  high but worth the experience if you have some extra cash.  Note - the poboy are very large and can be split between two people.

Probably because they've always done it that way).

The place seemed incredibly unclean, with food spilling all over the cafeteria style set-up they had, and on to us in line. When they would scoop rice, or greens out of the bins that they were in, it would slop out under the splash guard and fall on the floor, and got on our shoes. It was obvious this wasn't cleaned often as there was a lot of dried and crusted residue on the front of the unit. 

The workers moved slow, and often had their fingers in the bowls they were scooping into. They were also munching on food as they worked. It made my stomach turn watching them prepare the food, and I changed my order before we got to the register. I guess this probably happens at all places but seeing the food for such long periods of time before you order it and having time to watch these things makes you want to not eat it. I wanted the soul food but it looked so gross sitting in crusty trays and in so much grease, being handled by staff that didn't seem to be following code, that I tried to order an omelette, but my order ended up all wrong, and it was disgusting. I barely ate any of it.

Meanwhile, my husband got red beans, rice, and sausage, which was amazing, and my in-laws all got beef po'boys, which were also delicious, (I tried everything they had), but my appetite was really lost after being in the place for so long and watching the conditions overall.

The tired, tanned, and soon-to-be sick version of me was ready for reintroduction to real food (sorry, Carnival), and I couldn't imagine a better place to do just that than Cochon, a restaurant with a reputation for inventive, southern cuisine, and one of Bon Appetit's '20 Most Important Restaurants in America'. Well, they were closed. So, we tried Root, a hip new restaurant receiving a lot of press in the port area recommended of fellow food blogger, Megan (I Run For Wine). Also closed... Damn. How about Stanley's extremely popular brunch? Well, my fellow patrons weren't exactly interested in a one-mile walk in the rain.... it was time to consult a concierge. She recommended Mother's Restaurant, just a few blocks away. In hindsight, while we may have missed some opportunities to dine at a few amazing establishments, we did not go wanting for some delicious, home-style NOLA breakfast.

My cousin-in-law (one day, fingers-crossed, hint hint, wink wink, GIVE ME A DAMN RING--I'm only kidding, kind of), Jonathan, and his wife, Heather, joined me in this deceivingly large restaurant, tucked inside an unassuming brick building. The line to order had already formed, so we took our place and perused the menu. After ordering our breakfast spoils, we navigated a variety of rooms, already filled with hungry breakfast crowds, and found a table in the large, open air bar room (and yes, your breakfast can come fully-equipped with a mimosa, bloody mary, or beer). We decided to skip alcohol, at least until we made it to the airport, where there really isn't anything better to do.

After the quick exchange of smiles and receipts with a waitress, our food was brought to us as it was ready. Mine was the first to come, and despite attempting to show my southern manners, I dug in after a little encouragement from Jonathan. Say hello to the crawfish etouffee omelet: a fluffy omelet, filled and covered with crawfish etouffee, a Louisiana classic filled with green onions, garlic, sweet onions, celery, Cajun spices, and creamy goodness; mixed with the grits alone, it was amazing.

I came here because its purported to have some of the best food around. Although the food was great, the service has much to work on. 
The ladies behind the register and the doorman were lovely. There is also a server who speaks Spanish that overheard my mother ask me a question and she politely answered it in Spanish.

When we sat in our section we weren't greeted. While we waited, the table beside us had made various complaints to and about the server. The server took our receipt and came back later with only part of our food. I had to flag him down to make sure there was more coming. The server eventually brought our waffle, once my mother was done with her side items, but the waffle came without the topping she ordered; the server dropped it off fast and gave no opportunity to ask about the topping. He also did not check on us at all. I flagged him down the next time I saw him and asked if I could get reimbursed the difference for the topping on my bill as my mother was nearly done with her food and we had no opportunity to talk the the server earlier. He walked off muttering and got a manager. The manager reimbursed us, and did not bother to apologize regardless how politely we asked for our difference in return. 

I had Mae's omelette, which features black ham, green peppers, and mushrooms. It is served with grits, a warm biscuit, and blueberry jam. The ham was out of this world, and I am not the biggest fan of ham. I was so full, but kept picking at the ham left in my omelet. The biscuit was everything you hope for in a southern biscuit.

I think out of all the restaurants we had looked at on our trip I was the most excited for this one. So many people had recommended this place for the history and the food.

The lady they had at the door was very sweet and gave great direction. Be ready for the lines because they will be long which indicates the food is good, right?! 

The line is where my opinions start changing. It's hot and you're packed in while everyone is looking at the menu. I stood next to my fianc√© but apparently I couldn't do that as there was no signage posted. I got a very inappropriate and extremely rude awakening as one of the older ladies LOUDLY exclaimed, ""Mama move out of the way. Take your big wide hips and squeeze in mama. Keep going keep going. Stay there this is my walkway."" Now, I don't get offended easily and goodness gracious I'm a southern girl who likes food and I do have some hips on me but good Lord in heaven there is absolutely no reason to be unnecessarily RUDE. It made me VERY uncomfortable and the group behind us kept saying, ""Poor girl. That was mean."" Yes, yes it was. I was squeezed in so tightly the first time she said something but she took it too far. Still extremely embarrassed we made our way to the cashier who was an amazing multi-tasker. She was great!

We found a table pretty easily and our waitress brought our drinks but just a heads up you will pay $2.75 for a teeny tiny drink that you will not get refilled the entire time you are there. Your waitress will be right next to you and...NOPE, will not acknowledge you.

This place was recommended by the employee at the Best Western where we were staying. This place has been around for 70+ years and it looked busy which was a good sign. We grabbed a menu and ordered with the cashier and sat down to wait for the food. The line moved pretty quickly. I had a cup of crawfish etoufee and jerry's jambalaya which cost me $14. The two cups came with some bread and butter. I happily started eating since I was hungry and it tasted good especially the etoufee. The jambalaya flavor was good but the rice was too sticky and mushy for my liking. The etoufee was rich, buttery spiced goodness. i soaked it up with the bread. Sounds good right?

Then why did I give this place 3 stars then? Well two things: price and the fact that I found better places for etoufee and jambalaya later. My friend, Chris K., ordered the fried combo catfish, shrimp and fries plate and he added the a cup of jerry's jambalaya and crawfish etoufee for $2 more. When I found that out, I felt cheated. I know it was my fault for not looking at the menu closer and doing the math better, but 1) when I'm hungry doing the math is the last thing I want to do and 2) really, does the difference have to be that much? The feeling of being ripped off left a sour taste in my mouth, kind of like the feeling of Carnegie Deli but this place at least had good food.",2008-09-23 00:54:43,35.0,1397,35.0,0.13059701492537312,0.13059701492537312,0.936418189958592,0.936418189958592

I ordered the rice and beans entree and the side of green beans and tomato. My mom ordered the rice and beans plate with cabbage and sausage as her sides. I also got a mimosa which had a nice kick. We both thought the rice and beans were decent, but a little too heavy with the pork inside. My green beans and tomato dish was quite good and full of flavor. Her cabbage was disappointing, as it was more some kind of meat than it was cabbage. She only finished one sausage link, stating that it wss nothing special.

Overall, the food was decent, though a bit disappointing. Would definitely not wait in the long line that they likely have at dinner. On a side note, all of the aforementioned dishes--aside from the sausage--on the menu were marked with a ""V"" for vegetarian, which was clearly a flat out lie.

There was one thing he told my boyfriend and me to do when we got to the city, and that was ""go to Mother's.""  And we did.

I was there with two other people, and we went for lunch (I've heard that breakfast is a much different story).  We ordered at the counter, I ordered the Turkey Ferdi, and the two guys I was with ordered similar Po-Boys.  As we waited for our food, we admired the hundreds of autographed pictures on the walls, and thought to ourselves that this place must really be something if all these famous people came here...

When the server came to our table for the first time, she delivered one sandwich, which we would soon learn was the first of many strange errors in our time there.  My friend Andy touched the sandwich and decided that this can't be what he ordered (it was soggy and didn't have any gravy on it), the waitress came back, asked if he touched it, and when he said yes, rolled her eyes, huffed, grabbed the sandwich and walked away.  Is that all, you ask?  Not so much.  The waitress then came back with two sandwiches, AND a cup of gumbo and some crawfish etouffee.  Remember when I said we just ordered three sandwiches? Yeah.  Anyway, we told her that we didn't order these things, and she told us not to worry about it (despite signs saying not to tip the servers, she told us to tip them anyway, and we could keep the side dishes), then walked away and came back with the other sandwich.  We decided to try the etouffee and gumbo first, and after each of us had taken two bites of each, ANOTHER waitress came to our table, informed us that we hadn't ordered these items, and took them away.  This seemed spiteful, and a total waste of good food, but nonetheless, we had our Po-Boys to dive into, so oh well.  These Po-Boys were not what any of us were expecting, given the raving recommendation from plane guy - the meat was dry and the bread was definitely soggy - but we were hungry and ate them anyway.  I don't often give something a thumbs down after one experience, but everything that occurred was so backward, that I probably won't go back.  Sorry, plane guy, Mother's gets a thumbs down from me.

Yes, the waiting line does go out the door and wrap around the building, but nonetheless with the large selection of delicious food available at Mother's, you'll be busy spending half your time in line just deciding what you'd like to sink your teeth in-- so don't feel intimidated by the long line!  The only reason why the line is so long is because there are only 2 cash registers, and well, the staff are busy getting people their food!  The restaurant is huge and accommodating to large groups (we were in a group of 9), and the waitresses there definitely live up to the 'southern hospitality' reputation.

6) Eat

first trip, I had grits with debris... YUMMMMMMM!!!!! and also a cup of fruit (was trying to be healthy in anticipation of what was to come the rest of the day)
second trip... Crawfish etouffee... z0mg!!!! and the Ralph po'boy (Ferdi special with cheese)... the ham indeed is very delicious... but my friends and I kind of cheated a bit... we had some amazing queso fundido from El Mesquite Grill with us, and that was slathered onto our sandwiches... needless to say, with or without the extra cheese... the Ralph is the way to go!",2011-08-09 06:58:54,10.0,849,10.0,0.06711409395973154,0.06711409395973154,0.3431991115272901,0.3431991115272901

After being traumatized I didn't see Lebron, Drake, the carter's or anyone famous on the one weekend they're all there , lets just say I needed a fried chicken pick me up.

Location: Just walk, it's in the heart of the shopping area & you will never get a close spot, we parked in the mall garage it was cheaper then the lots (free first hour, $4 for 2-4 hrs) 

Wait: the wait suuuuucked but what can you do? we got there just before it wrapped around the whole building. After waiting about 30 min outside & being starving Mother's broke our hearts like a disneyland ride & as the staff let us in the door it was another line (this wait was faster 15min).

Service: There is no table service, so at least I didn't have to deal with them continuously but the two cashiers had an attitude on them, I changed my mind on a side & switched, I wouldn't suggest doing that, she sighed & threw my receipt at me. Bad day hopefully?

They're famous for their baked ham and Ferdi special po-boy sandwiches (french bread topped with roast beef, ham and 'debris' - gravy/meat juices).  It's very busy at lunch and their can be a line-up outside.  We lucked out and got a seat right away.

No-frills place - you get a laminated menu when you come in, line-up to order, find a seat where you can, and someone brings your food to you.  They serve classic southern fare - beans and rice, po boys, jambalaya, gumbo, etc...  Very basic decor and service.

The food was only OK though.  I had the shrimp po-boy which was HUGE.  It was enough for 2 lunches for me.  One of the shrimp wasn't fully peeled so that was a bit icky.  It was pretty bland - not worth the $13.  Hubby had a modified Ferdi... can't remember the name, but it's the one with cheese added.  He enjoyed it but I wasn't a huge fan.

It's low-key enough - there's only one sign outside the corner-joint, and the inside looks like your everyday cafe/deli. Get in line, place your order at the register, and wait for your plate to be brought out to you. They've got all the staple Cajun/Creole dishes, like gumbo, po'boys, fries, etc ...

I went for their most famous po'boy, the Ferdi, which is loaded with ham, roast beef, and debris. Now, debris is Mother's term for the pan-bottom scraps of roast beef that have cooked in the drippings during the roasting process, so these pieces are loaded with flavor and juice. Flavorwise, the sandwich was good, but it tasted flat. There were no dynamics to it, no dancing of heat or depth that I was expecting of a sandwich of such purported caliber. Also, there was too much jus that came along with the sandwich, rendering the bread really soggy. I'm all for a wet sandwich, but this was too much. Also, the meats were a bit cold, which I was not expecting. Maybe that's the style, but it would be miles better if they used hot meats. Dining suggestions: load up the Crystal on it for some kick - you'll need it.

After that, I felt a bit let down. I saw a cop and a dude sharing a table near the door, so I asked them about Mother's and what the locals thought of it. Turns out, the one guy was the manager, who admitted that the place was catering to tourists and that locals really don't frequent the shop. This would explain the quality.

If management can find a way to rejuvenate the food, the vibrancy can come back. I just wasn't feeling it at all during my visit. And that's a shame.",2013-01-11 15:31:34,15.0,1767,15.0,0.046296296296296294,0.046296296296296294,0.3568395510523549,0.3568395510523549

It's in NOLA's business district which looks more like the downtown of any other city, yet on a hot Saturday afternoon when the area was pretty desolate, the only people I saw were the ones waiting on line outside of Mother's.

We walked in and saw a big line and a cafeteria-style display of Mother's meats, soups, and other foods. However, unlike what we expected, the display was just a tease and the line was only for placing orders with the cashier. Between the time we got on line and the time we had to order, we had about 5 minutes to go through a massive menu that had too many attractive things to choose from. When I got to the cashier, I spent about a minute muttering various words like po'boys, fried chicken, jambalaya and biscuits without making any sense. I could tell from the cashier's unsympathetic expression that I wasn't the first one to be overwhelmed by choices so I ordered the Ferdi Special po'boy and a cup of seafood gumbo. 

After ordering, we looked for a table in the deceptively wide-open space. There are 3 dining rooms in the restaurant, and the further you go back, the newer and more sparsely decorated they get. We sat way back in a room that looked like an old warehouse and probably gets used for private parties. After about 10 minutes of waiting, a server took our receipts and brought out our food. 

The Ferdi Special is one of Mother's specialties and is a po-boy filled with the restaurant's amazing ham, roast beef, debris, and gravy...Mother's proudly advertises its ham as ""world's best"" and it is reallly good, thickly sliced country ham. Of course, I was curious about what ""debris"" was and found out it's basically meat drippings from the roast beef slathered in the sandwich..and now I will be putting debris on everything.  Altogether, the Ferdi was like a hammy french dip sandwich with gravy on the bread. What heightened the sandwich into legendary status for me though was the crunch of cabbage, mayo and mustard. I recently discovered how good cole slaw can be on any meat sandwich, and Mother's cabbage concoction added the texture and creaminess that took this po'boy to another level. 

The seafood gumbo was flavorful but for $6.25, the portion I got was really small and kind of disappointing. On the other hand, my friends' breakfast food looked amazing, and the biscuits you get are handmade, big, and fluffy. On top of all that, we shared an order of the decadently sweet bread pudding--one bite was enough for me. 

As we walked out stuffed, shrimp po'boys, fried chicken, and ham from other tables stared at me, tempting me to move to New Orleans to be close to Mother's.

1) They yelled at us for walking in (even though our friend was in the line) and the lady started calling management soon after. Couldn't she keep her calm and establish a conversation with us? No problem, we'll walk right back outside, but really there was NO NEED TO YELL. It was almost embarrassing. I felt very out of place, maybe because of my race or because i'm a tourist. She just didn't like it and it was a very negative experience. 

2) FOOD: Good. I had the combo Shrimp and Oyster Po Boy and i loved it. Pricy $18 for what it was but very good. Plenty of nicely fried shrimp and oysters in a light layer of mayonnaise. 

3) Fried Chicken $11. It was good, the pieces were huge and it came with a biscuit (we didn't know and had ordered another biscuit separately) BUT i have had better fried chicken (Willie's was way better) and in other places (Yardbird, Sweet Chick). So, i would skip it if you're a fried chicken connoisseur. Plus the wait was too long. 

4) Roast Beef, I got to try it from my friend and it was AMAZING. Really delicious and so much food in one plate! Share it.

5) Cafe au lait. Eh.

I had the fried shrimp Po'Boy same story with this order, nothing to write home about. The mood is set from the moment you order after waiting in a guaranteed line since you have to wait outside first to get in that line. I do not mind doing so when the outcome is above expectations. The cashiers are quite rude and wanting to rush you to the next person. I could sense that others felt the same way from the looks on their faces. When I asked for Ice T's she asked if I wanted a half or whole. I said whole and asked what the difference is....no answer. I did not see any various sizes of cups so I am still perplexed what the heck a half or whole drink is.

Wife ended up spilling her ice tea and we started cleaning up. After 4 waiters walked by seeing us wiping she asked one guy if he had any extra napkins. He brought some, assisted and was mumbling under his breath the whole time enough for her and I to look at each other with surprised looks.  Save your money and go elsewhere.

Honey ordered the file gumbo (huge bowl for $9), which tasted like chicken and rice soup -- very thin and bland.  They used a blonde roux instead of a dark roux, very few spices, and the sausage was the least flavorful I've had in Louisiana - not recommended.

I ordered the crawfish gumbo (another HUGE bowl for $12), which was thick and rich, although it could have also benefitted from a heavier hand with the spices.  I found that several dashes of Tabasco sauce perked it up nicely -- I would order this again.

Our food was served with two huge chunks of French bread with several pats of real butter -- yummy.  I can see how this bread would make fabulous po'boys.

I'll be brief in my review - this place was highly recommended by a few people. The line out the door on a Sunday morning was discouraging but moved reasonably briskly (I'd say we waited on line for 25 minutes total). In sum, Mother's is nothing special.

I had to order the Ferdi Po Boy (roast beef, baked ham, cole slaw, bunch of other stuff) because it has been featured on all those travel shows (and Man v. Food) and raved about here and elsewhere. It was pretty tasty, but I discerned nothing really special about it - in other words, it was merely the sum of its meaty parts.

It's family run by an old legacy of U.S. Marines, and the walls testify to that. This is the real deal of mom and pop food joints.

Their specialty is the french dip po-boy, specifically the ""Debris"", which is the roast beef that crumbles into the au jus when they're slicing it for roast beef po-boys. They scoop it up with the au jus and dump in onto a french roll. Incredible.

If you're looking for fine dining, go elsewhere-- and there are lots of great choices for that (Brennan's, Commander's Palace, even the Gumbo Shop). If you want quiet and refinement, you're probably in the wrong city (with a few notable exceptions!)

Wrong wrong wrong! The place was pretty dirty. There were plenty of tables with dirty plates all over. 
The guy who took our order was pretty nice and friendly. After that u get a table and a server. Apparently you give them your ticket and they proceed to bring the food out. Our server was not happy to see us. She seemed bothered we were there. Once she brought us our food, we never saw her again. We needed napkins, refills, and an extra plate because we were sharing many of the platters. But we managed. We took the napkins ourselves from a pile in a server station and went around to the front to ask the cashier for refills. 
The food was very good. We had the Ferdi special Poboy  and the combination platter.  
The combination platter included jambalaya, red beans and rice, potato salad, and crawfish etouffee. Although I found the prices a bit high the food was quiet delicious. The Ferdi special was juicy and flavorful!!! The combination platter was really tasty and appetizing!!! We ended up ordering another one because one was not enough to share.
Our experience was not the best but we made the best out of it. To be honest I don't know if I'll ever go back. There's a big hype about this place but to start off, the service is simply awful.

Boy, this place is OVERATED if you want regular New Orleans cuisine. Good thing we decided to go to this place at an odd time of 4pm so we had no wait. If we had, I would have been mad. Here, I ordered an oyster po'boy, gumbo, and my friend ordered grits and fried catfish. Grits was terrible that it almost was not palatable. After my friend put in a ton of salt and butter, it became just a bit edible. Po'boy was the most expensive I've had in New Orleans! $14??!! and it wasn't that great. Gumbo was the worst gumbo I had...no flavor at all...just bleh! yuck!  

Overall, this restaurant was the first restaurant where it was hard to finish the food. Unfortunately, I didn't have a good experience as others.

I found you conveniently located right across the street from my hotel.  I made a big mistake by not visiting you first as my first dining experience in your fair city was god awful with me and my mates' stumbling into a ""tourist trap"" in the worst sense. Now, I do understand you are a bit of a tourist trap in your own right, but your food is solid.  In fact it was the polar opposite of my first stop in every sense.  Your restaurant is splendid in many ways.  You were my first meal of 2009 (not counting a lucky dog I was told I had around 4 am off of bourbon) and I couldn't have done much better.  We stumbled over at about 10 am having had a solid 4 hours of sleep from NYE the night prior.  The building was a beautiful brick building and the order line was cafeteria style with plenty of smiling faces.  We got in line and looked at the great menu, while we were in line an employee walked up and put a big pan of fried bacon bits, kind of like pork rinds next to us and encouraged us to sample.  Obviously, he could tell we had a long night.  I ordered the meat and egg biscuit with yoru world famous ham and also the grits with cheese and debris.  My friends ordered similiarly.  We all had a bloody mary as well which was spiced well albeit lacking a premium vodka.  We sat and were brought our food swiftly by a large round faced older women who was as friendly as couldl be.  The biscuit was light fluffy and buttery.  The ham was delicious and as good as any I've had.  The grits were okay, and the debris (roast beef n gravy) was delicous.  I could have ate this all day.  The space itself was historic and beautiful with exposed brick, plenty of old pictures to give us a sense of history and the service was friendly. THank you for starting my 2009 off so well.  In fact, paradoxically I had one of the worst meals of the year for my last meal in 2008 in your city and one of my best so far as the first meal of 2009.  This seems very much to me to hopefully be a metaphor of a new start in all things in 09'.",2009-01-10 13:50:37,37.0,2044,37.0,0.08788598574821853,0.08788598574821853,0.8183918171270463,0.8183918171270463

since eating at mother's over 5 years ago, i've been known to put coleslaw on everything -- sandwiches, hot dogs, hamburgers - whatever it is, i really don't care as long as it's topped with coleslaw.

my only regret is that i didn't get the chance to eat here twice because it's seriously that good.

I ALSO TRIED

- Andouille Sausage (4/10)

Had a company outing to NOLA, and I got tasked to find the places for dinner. Now, I got an earful for picking Mother's because this was supposed to be expensed, and I picked such a dive. But seriously, the rest of our party was pretty lit before we came. If I recall correctly, we all had at least 3 pints of beer and 4 shots of Jager, and already acting goofy (my tolerance is a bit higher than these guys). Plus everyone's in shorts and t-shirt, I'm not going to get a reservation at some upscale restaurant! 

In any case, when I visit a new place, I go to Yelp and find the most reviewed restaurant and try to go there. Since one in our party gets nauseous at the sight of Oysters, we couldn't go to Acme Oyster House (#1 in NOLA), so I settled for #2, and here we are.

FERDI SPECIAL & MOTHER'S BEST BAKED HAM
So everyone goes nuts over this Ferdi thing I guess. It's their OMG Universe Famous Baked Ham, roast beef, debris (basically roast beef that cooked in its own gravy), gravy, and some mustard, shredded cabbage, etc. Anything with the name ""Famous"" in it means I gotta try it! 

This Po Boy is monstrous, by the way, Put together, it's probably like a 14 inch sandwich, and it's tall too! So I take this first bite, waiting for the Creole seasoning to make my mouth water, the mustard to heighten my senses, and the oh-so-famous ham to provide even more seasoning and end it with a nice sweet flavor that only baked hams can bring, but......... I waited, and waited. Hm, must be a dud. Took another bite....and waited. Something was wrong here!

Normally I blame bread, because bread tends to suck out flavor and inject its own boringness into it, so I removed the bread and tried the oh-so-famous ham by itself. The texture was there, but both the seasoning and flavor were not! Where did they go?! I tried the slice of roast beef, and it too was seasonless and almost flavorless! The mayo and mustards were evident, but even their flavors were getting sort of overwhelmed by the Nothing (Neverending Story anyone?). Seriously, all the meats and the bread were basically acting as flavor suckers, and it really tasted like a water flavored sandwich! 

Eventually, I had to use some Crystal hot sauce just to get anything out of it. Blah, what a waste! THIS is what everyone craves? I don't get it!

SEAFOOD GUMBO
Now, this was good. The crawfish in it definitely came out (tastes like shrimp). It was a little watery in texture, but the flavors were nice and spicy. The crawfish didn't taste fishy (like my gumbo from the night before), but had a very good shrimpy flavor to it. Seasoning was just ok, it could've been seasoned a little more in my opinion. Solid, though. Believe it or not, I'd still take Heaven on Seven (in Chicago) over this. Maybe it's the fact that Heaven is the traditional chicken/Andouille sausage that adds its own seasoning instead of just crawfish. 

CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE
So, in my mind, this and gumbo seem very similar. I'm sure all of NOLA is about to kick my ass now, but seriously, I think they're similar. They have differences in taste, such as the gumbo being ever so slightly more tangy, maybe because of the tomato base, and etouffee being more...seafoody? I don't know. It had the same great shrimpy flavor as the gumbo, but it was a little thicker and a little spicier, which I liked. Also like the gumbo, I wish it was seasoned a little more. I added some Crystal hot sauce to this, and it gave me my seasoning, but the additional flavors were unwelcome. 

ANDOUILLE SAUSAGE
Got a separate order of some of these, and I was kind of disappointed. The flavors weren't as strong as I would have expected, considering that the Andouille in other dishes I've had was very pronounced. Here it was kind of dull. The texture was also interesting. It felt like it wasn't quite packed as tightly as, say, a polish sausage or even a brat. I was really hoping for more spice and seasoning, but it was lacking. It didn't even really have a pungent flavor either. It seemed very conservative and timid, which was completely unlike our party, since us drunk fools all had a couple more beers at Mothers! LOL!

MOTHER PLEASE!
I am very disappointed in the #2 most famous joint in NOLA. The bartender at our hotel even told us that Mother's is sort of an overpriced letdown. I couldn't agree more. I mean, I'd do anything to have ready access to Mother's gumbo and etouffee at home (Heaven on Seven is not the easiest place to get to, so as much as I love it, I've only been twice), but I wouldn't make a trip out here to try Mother's food.

Inside it's a disaster-- not the cleanest place, and I sat next to some kitchen supplies! Anyway, I ordered the platter: crawfish etoufee, greens, jambalaya, rice and beans, and potato salad in the middle.
- crawfish etoufee: its on top of rice, salty--and you need a microscope to find the crawfish
- red beans and rice: more rice (perfectly cooked)
- jambalaya: more rice, over cooked rice, tomato paste rice.
- greens: least fave--smoky flavor, but there's something else in them that I did not enjoy at all
You can't even enjoy the bread because it's as hard as a crouton... how do you mess up bread?

Now this should be just called the rice sampler. Everything is rice different. One would think, they have thought about giving you rice on the side instead of each item on top of rice. This makes no sense! I got a side of gumbo--again, it was on top of rice. My side of green beans w/tomato was just okay.

The rice platter is $20.. about $10 overpriced for plate of rice.
 
Now there's a sign that says ""OUR EMPLOYEES DO NOT TAKE TIP"" I do not tip. Esp. with how high their rice platter is.

So I arrive into MSY last Sunday, the 19th, and no more than 10 minutes after checking into my hotel and throwing my stuff into my room, made a beeline for Mothers.  I expected something that would make me sound like I was in a NYC deli, but I was only left with a ""ooh"" rather than an ""OMG, yes! Yes! Yes"".

I had no idea if there would be a line or not, but thankfully there was no one waiting when I got there around 3pm.  There might have been 2-3 people in front of me, but that's it.

I ordered the combination plate (16.00) that had jambalaya, crawfish etouffee, red beans & rice, a potato dish of some sort, and turnip greens.  The jambalaya and crawfish etouffee were great.  The red beans and rice were bland.  The greens were good.  The potato dish was so-so.  On a different day, I ordered the bread pudding to go.  Once I got back to the hotel to eat it, I realized they poured what seemed to be butter over the top of it.  I poured that part of it out and ate the bread pudding.  I have to say, it was delicious.  It made me shudder to think it had absorbed all that buttery stuff, but damn it was good!

Most have been yummy fried seafood sandwiches in great white French bread with lettuce and mayo and tomato. 

Mother's was recommended by a friend as a place to stop in New Orleans, and while stopping to get our bearings at Poydras Ave, we realized it was right across the street and stopped in.

You do want to have an idea of what you want when you get in, because you grab a menu and a table and then go up to the cashier and order your food and sit back down.

We had the Jerry's Jambalaya and a Ferdi's Special po-boy (2/3 size). The sandwich had some pink ham, some black crispy ham, and the very delicious debris, and was ""dressed"" the Ferdi's way. It was very tasty, and quite different from the seafood po-boys I had tried everywhere else. After reading up a bit about po-boys, I think this is a more ""authentic"" take on a sandwich that has now come to mean any large white French roll stuffed and dressed. The 2/3 size was more than enough for this manly eater and still leave enough to share with my girl.

My girl shared her Jerry's Jambalya with me as well, and damn, it was delicious. After trying a few bland etouffees, gumbos, and jambalayas in the French Quarter, this one stood out as being rich, spicy, and not too spicy.

I liked that they had a sink and soap and paper towels right out in the hallway, if you wanted to rinse your hands without entering the bathroom. It is a nice touch.

Some people have complained here about the high prices and the staff's service. I didn't have any problem with the service, I am used to cafeteria style service at extremely popular spots, and each member of the staff usually has specific duties in order to keep things running smoothly and efficiently. The staff all seem to be in good spirits to me, and I felt welcome. The other thing to keep in mind is that you are forbidden to tip the staff there, so take the 15-20% you should have tipped off of your bill, and the prices are now pretty competitive for food that is authentic and unique.",2010-10-13 14:32:31,25.0,2126,25.0,0.06377551020408163,0.06377551020408163,0.5421985834147932,0.5421985834147932

-breakfast is a normal breakfast.  I've had better at our local coney place in Detroit.
-prices are above average for the food, but normal for the area of the city (because, ya know, tourists)
-service is subpar, which is fine because there're signs everywhere saying you should NOT tip (which our waitress denied)

Honestly, the food was okay. We tried the infamous ""Ferdi"" and it was a total gut bomb...a tasty gut bomb...but a gut bomb none the less. 

So food review aside...it's the people watching that's tops at this joint. It starts in line, where you get to interact with the most interesting characters. Then, when you get inside, you get yelled at by the unhappy servers, trying to maneuver around all the bodies shuffling like zombies in line. THEN you get up to the station where you order your food and see the ancient ladies behind the counter making it...oh child, they talk some serious $h!# behind that counter...and they give you the stink eye if you make eye contact...don't make eye contact!!

Once you order your food, then you go wander around the might halls of Mother's for a place to sit (this place is HUGE). Once you sit, you notice a sign hanging by your table that tells you tipping the wait staff is not needed. HOWEVER, said wait staff will drop MAD HINTS and not so subtle hints that they really do expect you to tip...super uncomfortable.

The restaurant is pretty easy to find - look for the long lines at all hours of the day.  The line moves fairly quickly, as the restaurant is huge.

Once you step inside, you'll need to step into another line to place your order.  You'll be able to see the food being prepped and review the specials of the day.  Know what you want, because that line also moves fairly quickly and there is no time for anyone to hem and haw.  There are a lot of people they need to serve!

We were there a few minutes before 11 am and were told we could not order off the regular menu as breakfast was still being served.  We decided to step back to let a few parties move in front of us but even that did not allow us enough time.  An employee noticed our dilemma and ushered us to the front of the line and told the cashiers to let us order from the lunch menu.  Others were having the same issue as us and it was creating problems.   Many thanks to that kind gentleman.

I ordered the shrimp and oyster po'boy with a side of dirty rice.  Be warned, their sandwiches are HUGE and can easily be shared.  The seafood was lightly battered and seasoned.  It was not the slightest bit greasy.  The sandwich came with mayo and some shredded cabbage on a soft, thick sandwich roll (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mothers-restaurant-new-orleans?select=CqOy-1uLjwIG5L1McsSR2Q#CqOy-1uLjwIG5L1McsSR2Q).  A few dashes of hot sauce and squirts of lemon juice completed the sandwich for me.  Overall I the sandwich was okay.  Nothing out of this world, but it was just as I had expected and it was good.  The only bad side, if this can be a bad thing, was that there was just so much food!  I ended up eating only one half of the sandwich and then picking out the seafood from the other half.

As for the dirty rice, I quite enjoyed it.  I shared this cup of rice with my friends and we all thought it was good.  The rice was cooked well, and the bits of meat-to-rice ratio was good.  Seasoning was spot on.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mothers-restaurant-new-orleans?select=9qtVZCaYNV0ucwis2HwaFw#WFc4lbeegnG_0zktkmKYeg

One friend ordered the Famous Ferdi Special, which comes with ham, roast beef, debris and gravy and loved it.  I tried some of it and thought it was delicious.  It could have easily fed three of four people!  

Another friend ordered the omelette and noticed that the eggs were prepared ahead of time and filled to order.  From my sample taste I found it to be okay, but nothing I would go out of my way to order at Mother's.  Stick with what they are famous for, I say.

As for the service, I found the staff to be direct and efficient, but my friends found them to be bordering on rude.  Quite frankly the service was similar to what I've seen in many other super busy/packed restaurants.  The staff have a lot of tables to take care of and lots of requests to meet.  They do the best they can and don't have time for customers that don't know what they want.  Rude?  Not to me.

One of the cashiers was ringing up order and eating fries.

He said ""Don't worry about it,  I'll take care of it.""  Another 10 minutes passed and waffle came,  which was stone cold.  Sent it back.  Came back lukewarm.  Gave up on hope of getting a hot waffle.  Eggs came with grits smothering my eggs.  We had ordered toast instead, since we do not like grits. Instead they gave a mound of grits. We were looking forward to the ham, as it was given high praise in reviews. They gave us dried up end pieces. Gumbo was also lukewarm when we finally got it.  Gave up on hope of being served hot food.  By then just wanted to hurry up and leave with the knowledge of never to come back ever again.  We found it hard to believe one establishment could mess up on a  simple order and not even care about it.  Manager came later to check on our order in an unclear attempt to make things right by saying simply ""Is everything okay and can I get you a bread pudding?

It was packed and the line was out the door. I had heard about Mother's restaurant from a friend who recently took a trip out to NOLA and I noticed that Mother's was also a Zagat rated restaurant, so.. I had to try it. 

My boyfriend ordered the crawfish etouffee plate with two sides, grits with butter and red beans a rice. I ordered the famous Ferdi Special (Mother's best baked ham, roast beef, debris and gravy), as well as a small cup of seafood gumbo. 

Just note that everything here is not super salty, (that's my kinda place!) and I found it exceptionally strange because all the crawfish etouffee, gumbo etc in Texas always leaves me so parched afterwards. Needless to say, for those of you who have a saltier palate you may not enjoy Mother's as much. Anyhow, the crawfish etouffee is really good. The crawfish is fresh and they give you plenty of it! The red beans and rice is delicious. You can't really mess up grits, so those were good as well.  

My Famous Ferdi Special po'Boy was huge. I had no idea that a regular po'boy would be served on gigantic pieces of french bread, but I thoroughly enjoyed the taste of this sandwich. Next time I think I'll go with the ""2/3"" po'boy option. The gravy on the famous ferdi adds a nice touch to the savory mustard, roast beef combo. The gumbo was my favorite. Even in a small cup, I counted at least 4 or 5 oysters and 3 or 4 shrimp. It was delicious.

It's fried seafood on bread.  That's it.  There's no magic to it.  There's gravy.  There's also coleslaw of some sort (at least I think it was a vegetable).  But there's no magic.

The line may appear to be long but the size of the place is understated. Don't let the line fool you. The turnaround is fast and the plates fly out the kitchen. The price is A-OK. I typically come here every time I visit New Orleans and especially make the effort when I'm with people new to the city. 

Stuff I have had:

- Famous Ferdi's Special (quite filling and sometimes messy due to the roux)
- Breakfast Special (when I cant decide and just want all the breakfast stuff at one time)
- Fried Chicken (it comes out way faster than listed on the menu) 
- Any omelette (the build your own is better)

I really haven't deviated from these 4 items. There is a section for salads and I dont understand why it's there among all the amazing unhealthy food. It reminds me of the uselessness of McDonalds salads or adding gobs of ranch. Also, I've only eaten here in the mornings. It's part of my tradition. 

The funny thing about people who think it's overrated is that perhaps there is a place in their home town that is the bees knees to them and someone else thinks it's overrated.

I write this review in hopes of salvaging what would be a terrible and unnecessary meal for you in New Orleans. Despite my better judgement, a friend and I decided to venture to Mother's based on another friend's recommendation.

There are certainly aspects of Mother's that I love, like this is a tip-free establishment. This means that Mother's pay their employees a standard wage, not the usual $2.13 servers usually get. Having been a waitress myself, I love and appreciate this! I also love the history of this place. This place has been around forever! The people were warm and informative, but that's where it all ends. 

Between a friend and I, we tried a wide variety of the menu including the infamous ham that must have absorbed an entire canister of salt, etoufee that lacked any flavor and eve creole that left so much to desire.

We debated between Mother's and another well-known breakfast spot before opting to visit the more historic Mother's (opened in 1948). We weren't disappointed. 

Heading in for breakfast right when they open at 7 am is a good strategy for avoiding the lines that seem omnipresent here. 

Here's how it works: Grab a menu as you walk in the door and head to the cash register to place your order and pay. Get your drink and sit down in one of the 3 dining rooms. Keep your receipt out because your server will pick it up to get your breakfast pulled together. You'll get your receipt back when all of your food arrives - so if you've paid by cc and keep your receipts, there's no need to fret. 

We both ordered the breakfast plate. It comes with 2 eggs cooked how you like, a meat, grits and bread of your choice. There are a ton of meat options, from debris gravy to ham to bacon to smoked sausage and more. For our bread we went for the house biscuit. 

The biscuit was amazing and obviously homemade. It still had flour flecks on top. It was tall as all get-out, tender and tasty. It came with several pats of butter (under the biscuit so the butter would warm to spreadable consistency) and a little container of what we think was black raspberry jelly. 

The food plate was amazing. Way too much food, in fact. Grits cover the plate (served plain - no salt or butter, so be ready to add that if it's your style). Eggs are tucked underneath. The smoked sausage was crisp on the outside and juicy inside. The debris gravy - oh.my. The roast beef was incredibly tender and the au jus had a ton of flavor. 

We'd definitely go back. It was a fantastic meal to close out our time in NOLA!",2016-02-29 16:48:39,19.0,1720,19.0,0.059190031152647975,0.059190031152647975,0.45813068106189153,0.45813068106189153

From the long lines out of the door that keep you humble, to realizing that you have to wait some more when you first enter the door, to the crowded stuffy atmosphere of the place.  I say use the phrase down to earth to politely say that this place is a hole in the wall.

The staff is what you would expect for a busy place like this.  Not overtly rude, but has a frustrated, ""let's go, hon"" attitude when ordering.  It's most evident when you're standing in line waiting to order inside. There is no room to stand anywhere without somebody from the wait staff asking you to move aside.  

Now, with all that said, the sole reason that this place has 4 stars is because of the food.  I've noticed with a lot of authentic food, it's not usually the flair that comes with it, but the basic elements that undoubtedly mark the food in its category.  And this is stick to yo ribs soul food.

I have been to mothers a handful of times now, and every time I will order the BREAD PUDDING!  The bread is well soaked to the point where it melts in your mouth with every bite.  And small chunks of hot fruit explode with tangy goodness.

I have also had many of their breakfast items.  My buddy got the Ferdi Special after recommendations from other yelpers.  It seemed like too much bread, so he took the top bun off both half of his sandwiches off.  Other yelpers may take points off for ""no pickles"" or other dressings, but to me, the essence of a sandwich, if well put together, beats a frivilously dressed up sandwich anyday.

They claim their bloody mary is all that, but it always leaves me with heartburn and NEVER with the feeling that I've had anything alcoholic.

however its still a MUST GO TO SPOT in New Orleans.

Get there super early and be prepared to wait.
It's a tourist attraction like you would not believe.
I waited on line for at least 40 minutes to see what all my friends were raving about.

I had breakfast there. The food was good. (not great/ I've had better)
They give you so much food that you can literally order for one and share with 3.
Inside was very hectic (some cafeteria style madness in there). It's a lil overwhelming if its your 1st time there. There's a ""hurry up and order"" feeling that doesn't feel right.
I think it would be a much better experience if they took out the chaotic feel on the inside, but its New Orleans I guess.

Its so much chaos in there that its actually better to take food to go.

Overall, Its a pretty cool tourist spot to go to.
Pictures of famous faces are all over the walls...
It feels like New Orleans in here, which is good..

Note: I've only had breakfast there. I'm not a wait on line for 60 minutes kinda guy, so I passed on lunch.

So while I am no means a Nola expert, I consider myself pretty damn well-versed in Southern fare and reasonably so in Cajun cuisine. That being said, Mother's has the best down home food in the city. Certainly not the nicest atmosphere or best service (you can try Galatoire's or Antoine's for that) but the closest to what your mother makes if you're from the low country like me (obviously this joint is aptly named). Be prepared to wait in line and realize that the kitchen and waitstaff can't accept tips, so don't be impatient. The staff behind the counter is trained to be ""mean"" to speed up the process. They hand out menus in line, so know what you want in advance. Pay attention to what the black ladies behind the counter are talking about, they always know what's good. After you've ordered and found a seat, if you are very friendly (yes ma'am and no sir to the older workers, even if you're grown!) you can get advice on what to order next time and they may expedite your service. The bad reviews I've seen are from people that went in expecting too much from this humble institution, so let me give a few tips. Don't be afraid to ask your waiter if you need your food heated up. They will happily oblige (my friend got her gumbo warmed up last time we were there). This is a common problem because of the food line setup, but on the bright side, it does enable faster service. Now time for an unpopular opinion: the debris poboy is the most overrated menu item. Don't get me wrong, it still beats the shit out of a lot of other poboys I've had, but it's basically just pulled beef covered in gravy, which you can make pretty easily by letting beef sit in a slow cooker for several hours. As a result, it has that delicious, fall-off-the-bone quality. However, as gravy is one of my favorite sauces, I must say Mother's is quite lacking. While it has enough salt, it doesn't have the proper seasoning that comes from the homemade pan scrapin's kind and it's isn't thick enough, which means the roux needs to be cooked longer. The debris is better on the Ferdi, Ralph or John G., where the other meats give it more flavor. My favorites here are the breakfast special with scrambled eggs, fried ham and smoked sausage (it only comes with one meat, but spare a few bucks and get both), the crawfish √©touff√©e in its many reiterations (including an omelet, plate, and on its own), the oysters, shrimp and catfish all deep fried and served in poboy or plate form (with tons of extra tartar sauce), the seafood gumbo, and the fried chicken plate. Give 'em twenty or thirty minutes for cooking time on that last one but it'll be damn worth it (theirs could rival my own grandmother's but shh don't tell her that!) If you want something large enough to share, the seafood platters are also fabulous, especially the soft shell crabs. For sides, the cabbage, turnip greens and grits are incredible (the vegetables are cooked in their famous ham, which gives them wonderful flavor). They serve breakfast all day, so make sure you get a biscuit regardless of what you order. They are made in true Southern fashion, with high quality flour, buttermilk and lard. Load one up with butter and their house-made raspberry preserves and you have the perfect finishing touch to your meal. If you go on a Saturday, I suggest the turtle soup and the fried chicken special. Turtle soup is a Creole delicacy and theirs is an excellent rendition, while the dirty rice served with the special is phenomenal. If by some bizarre stretch, you still have room for dessert after all of that, order the pecan pie. I always end up leaving with enough food for an army in take away boxes and getting it anyway. And don't forget to get a World Famous, a fruit punch based cocktail even better than a hurricane. P.S.

For starters, you walk past where they prepare the food, as well as already made sandwiches that were just covered in paper and flies which immediately turned me away from ordering any kind of sandwich on the menu. Second, you can hear ""NEXT"" all the way out the door from the rude ladies taking your orders which was far from the warm welcome we were all expecting. 

Our food took a while, though I'm not sure why considering it wasn't busy and it tasted like everything was freezer burnt and just thrown in a fryer for 2 seconds. Their fries aren't seasoned, catfish literally didn't taste like anything, not even the batter they cook with to fry it, and same goes for their shrimp. Gumbo and jambalaya bowls we had at the table were all cold as well and just thrown into our bowls without any hesitation to make it look good enough to eat.

Got the Ferdi which is one of their most popular sandwiches. Roast beef was dry and flavorless, and I couldn't even taste the ham. Bread seems a bit stale. We had to ask for more mustard, mayo, and pickles to make it edible. Even dousing it with their chili vinegar (which is not spicy btw) and hot sauce didn't really help. Granted, it's a big sandwich, esp if you eat the bread, but this just was not appealing to me.

Also got the seafood gumbo. $8.25 for a tiny cup and there was just shrimp inside, didn't see any other seafood. This was the blandest gumbo I ever had. One bite and I was done.

Ladies up at the front counter could not crack a smile to save their lives. However the lady in the back that brought us our food was great. Great smile and personality. I didn't notice the sign up front that says not to leave the workers tips, so I left our lady a few bucks, which she took of course.

My friend and I were fooled by the long lines and how popular on the ""Top 10"" lists this restaurant is. People were so unfriendly (I'm not from the South so I wasn't even expecting Southern hospitality) and we felt so rushed when ordering. Customers were expected to know their orders by the time they reached the counter, and this is the worst for first-timers like my friend and I who wanted to explore our options, get recommendations, and inquire about substituting options. This is the wrong place to do that.

We got the chicken po boy, shrimp po boy, jambalaya, √©touff√©e, bread pudding, and many more. We really went all out on this one, only to be completely disappointed! The savory dishes were either bland or too salty. I remember the shrimp po boy being a little burned and the √©touff√©e too watery. The bread pudding was the worst we had in all of NOLA. They may have monopoly on po boy in NOLA, but I've had much better po boys even on the West Coast.

Mind you, Mother's is not as cheap as it looks (and should be). There's also a no tipping policy, which is probably why it's so bad.

The ham I had as the meat was freezing cold and while I don't like it cold, to be fair, perhaps that's how they purposefully serve it. Either way it did not taste good, and lacked flavor. Grits were mediocre but you'd think it would be the most appetizing because of its soul food reputation. The biggest let down was the biscuit. As something I always look forward to, it was disappointing to find out it was not flaky, light, or the right consistency. It was quite dry, mealy, and was tough to go down - even with the butter or jelly.

We did make it there and were sorely disappointed.  The service was fine for a cafeteria style place - we were handed menus by a non-smiling host at the door and directed to order at the cash first and then sit down.  After studying the menu for a while and beginning to feel like the cashier was losing patience, we decided to order a soft shell crab po'boy and a roast beef po'boy to split amongst the three of us. We decided against any sides.  We then sat down and waited for our food.  

When it came, we were disappointed for a couple of reasons.  One was partly our fault - on the menu, the roast beef says it comes 'topped with debris'.  We didn't notice this when we ordered, so my mother thought she was getting just sliced roast beef on the sandwich.  There were a few slices of roast beef (maybe 3) that were pale grey in colour.  She was also turned off by the appearance of the debris - it's kind of like pulled pork but more as if someone has chewed it already.  This was our mistake, and my mother had a hard time eating it because of the appearance of the meat.  It was also not particularly flavourful, and the gravy made the bottom of the bun completely soggy.  Perhaps this is typical for po'boys, this was our first (and last) time ordering one in NOLA, so I'm not sure how 'typical' our sandwiches were relative to other restaurants.  My soft shell crab sandwich was ok - except it could more accurately be described as a 'lettuce, batter, and mayonnaise' sandwich on stale bread.  The soft shell crab was almost non-existent in the batter, although I did bite into a couple huge pieces of shell that I had to pull out of my mouth before I choked on them.  Again, it should be noted that this was my only experience with a po'boy whilst in NOLA so I have no comparison.  

We paid almost $30 for two 'small' sandwiches.  This seems to be expensive relative to what you are served.  Overall, this was a very disappointing experience and I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",2017-12-22 19:48:04,-5.0,2096,5.0,-0.012254901960784314,0.012254901960784314,-0.10921300708262974,0.10921300708262974

It's set in what I believe is still the central business district and we got there around 1pm so most of the people there were on their lunch break or with their children. We received a friendly greeting and were directed to the counter to order with our menus. After we ordered, the cashier told us to ""sit wherever you want baby"". Everyone in New Orleans calls you baby lol.

I ordered my first ever Shrimp Po' Boy. I was very concerned about how this was going to work because I thought it would just be fried shrimp on dry bread, but, to my surprise, they dressed it up a little with what tasted like cole slaw and pickles. I also drizzled a little lemon on it and it was amazing. Not too dry, not too wet.

My husband ordered the Ferdi Po' Boy with ham and roast beef. He really enjoyed the first half of his sandwich. Yes, I forgot to tell you that the Po' Boy is huge! You could really save the other half for later but it's so good why wait?

After we finished that, we got a bread pudding (a New Orleans staple) which was delicious! Perfect ending to our meal.

My pecan pie filling was nice and light, although still sweet and sticky.  The top was covered in candied pecans, and the crust was light and buttery.  I only wish I had asked for it to be warmed up a bit.

I should have realized that the Yelpers were right. every review said that Mothers was just ok... But there is something intriguing to me about a place with a long line...and Mothers also just happened to be by the W Hotel where I was staying. 

First of all they do some strange cafeteria/pseudowaiter service where you stand in line to read the menu, then you order and get your drinks then find a seat (are you confused? cause I was )then somebody brings your food to you after they come get your  receipt from you. I felt rushed by the line developing behind me so I just got the Gumbo and a Ferdi special.  

The gumbo was subpar the worst of the weekend, the shrimp was hella chewy like they were 2 day old. the soup was watery no thickness at all and kinda flavorless. . . the Ferdi special wasn't bad but it was also over rated Adam Richman said that mothers Debris which is the chopped beef and gravy topping was top notch I was terribly Underwhelmed it was actually dry I felt like putting a sauce on that shit like some ketcup, bbq some ranch anything.

 I had to ask for somebody to clean off a table out of the several people that looked unbusy one guy took care of that finally then we had to figure out what to do about silverware, I saw a bucket next to the door with what look like forks wrapped in napkins, ended up getting that myself. the 2 napkin holders next to us were empty so we borrowed some napkins from the table next to us since there pseudowaiter had just given them some...lot of work to do at Mother.

In my opinion, their local cuisine was pretty damn good, but I've had better ham sandwiches than their fergi special. 

We came here Mardi gras day and were surprised that there wasn't a giant lineup. We waited maybe 5 minutes before ordering at the cash. I ordered the crawfish √©touff√©e and the seafood gumbo. Our party also had the fergi sandwich, the jambalaya and the shrimp creole. 

The crawfish √©touff√©e was amazing. Get it if you come here. It's flavour is perfect and its served on a bed of rice. Such a nice change to have crawfish that isn't frozen to kingdom come. 

The gumbo was alright, personally I think I make a better gumbo. They had oysters in it which was kind of different, but otherwise there wasn't anything super special about it. It too is served with rice. 

The jambalaya had an overwhelming taste of crystal hot sauce. It kind of took away from the rest of the flavours. It's a shame because I think if they used cayenne instead it would have been a pretty good jambalaya. 

I didn't really like the fergi sandwich. Personally I found it dry and not tender. Then again, I've had my share of melt in your mouth Montreal smoked meat sandwiches, so this was like watching high school football instead of the NFL. 

The shrimp creole was pretty much tomato sauce with shrimp in it. I'm not sure if creole is supposed to be like that, but it seemed like I opened a can of pasta sauce. 

Anyways, I'd definitely want to come back here and try some of the other things. It's a place that takes a while to get to know, but once you do, you'll probably keep coming back.",2013-02-13 06:55:15,40.0,1758,40.0,0.1238390092879257,0.1238390092879257,0.954004791501098,0.954004791501098

So there's no question we'll be back next time we visit. And that's as good of a compliment as it gets with me as a foodie. When I travel I plan my meals and there's never enough time in the day to eat everywhere I want to! 

The only reason they lose a star from me, is the inconsistent tipping policy. There are signs all over saying to not tip, tips not necessary, staff cannot accept tips etc. Then, as we were leaving, we're told we can tip if we want to, it's up to us.

The Famous Ferdi Special is a po boy on French bread that's topped with roast beef, ham, debris (more on that in a minute), cabbage, pickles, creole mustard and mayo.

Let's go ahead and get this out of the way - I was disappointed in this sandwich.

The roast beef and ham were both rather unimpressive. Neither meat had a ton of flavor, and I thought the ham was particularly dry. For a place that boasts about having ""World Famous Ham,"" I was surprised.

However, despite thinking the meat was dry and lacking in flavor, I thought the complete opposite about the debris.

Debris is all the beef, juice and drippings that fall into a pan as a roast beef cooks. It was wonderful. Actually, I would have preferred to just have a debris sandwich. Has anyone tried doing that? If so, please send me your address. I'm coming over. Immediately.

As the juices from the debris began to seep into the French bread, it reminded me of the delicious flavors you get in a great Italian beef sandwich.

Next time, I'm asking for extra debris.

Overall, my po boy from Mother's wasn't quite what I was hoping for. Although the sandwich wasn't bad, it wasn't in the ""Best Thing I Ever Ate"" category. To be fair, maybe my expectations were a bit high.

I have to admit that I had no idea what debris was before coming here and I was definitely missing out on the tender, juice-laden roast beef---mmm,mmm good! Sandwich was topped off with a little bit of what I think was cole slaw and some spicy mustard. Very messy due to the juices from the debris, but very delicious!

It's just that unique New Orleans style.  The menu includes truly unique items like ""debris"", ""ferdi"" and ""black ham"", as well as the classic NOLA creoles, ettouffes, etc.

We went for an early lunch, arriving at 11:45.  There was a line, but it wasn't a problem.  Had we arrived only a few minutes later, though, it would have been more difficult since the line went all the way to the back of the restaurant.

Due to the short line and other extenuating circumstances (like two six-year-old children), I didn't have enough time to study the menu.  I ended up ordering the crawfish ettouffe.  It was excellent.  As we waited for the food to be delivered, I saw ferdi and debris po'boys being delivered, and wished I had taken more time with my order.  Oh well, now I have an excuse to go back.

As I mentioned, the ettouffe was excellent.  My wife had a catfish po'boy, which she truly enjoyed.  The kids both had excellent pancakes.   All were happy.

When you arrive at the restaurant, you get in line to place an order.  Once you have placed the order, you get a number and you choose a seat.  The order is brought to your table.  It made sense for me to give my order to Jane and go look for a table with the kids--we certainly had a better choice.'

I had the Ferdi Special po' boy which is half baked ham and half roast beef with some mustard and onions.  It was delicious but the beef was under spiced for something that has supposedly been bathing in it's own juices for hours on end.  The ham ain't got nothing on Virginia.  It wasn't more flavorful then any other normal ham.  It certainly wasn't the best baked ham (as they claim).  The gumbo wasn't that spicy and wasn't very memorable.

We took a five minute walk to Mother's from our hotel and walked-in (well, I did) prepared to get my eat on.  This place is similar to Philippe's in Los Angeles, but with a southern flare. 

If this is your first visit, I suggest that you get the Ferdi's special po boy that has debris (yes, that's what they call it)--the roast beef meat that falls off into the gravy and fully dressed with shredded cabbage, pickles, mayo, Creole mustard, and mustard.  It's like a French Dip sandwich, and it's pretty damn good!  Get the half size if you're eating by yourself, because it's easily a foot long even with the ""half-size"" and filled to the brim with fillings. 

We also ordered a cup of jambalaya to share between us.  It was slightly spicy but was filled with chicken, andaouille sausage, rice and whatever goodness they put into that little cup.  

I was hungry from a day of travelling, and wolfed down the po boy, AND finished off the jambalaya.  Needless to say, I slept very well that evening!

One thing is that you do need to know what you're doing when you walk-in, cause otherwise you hold-up the line.  Here are some pointers:

-  walk-in and grab a menu
-  fall in line
-  browse through the menu items as you make your way up
-  know what you want before they get to you
-  order from the cashier
-  sit down with your receipt in hand
-  someone from the restaurant will ask you for your receipt and will eventually bring the food out to you
-  if you order gumbo or jambalaya, they will serve it out from the counter you passed as you made it to order, go and grab it",2008-10-21 19:08:41,14.0,1637,14.0,0.044585987261146494,0.044585987261146494,0.34602198721809985,0.34602198721809985

Inside the restaurant the tables are packed so close together that it makes it hard to move around. You actually give your receipt ticket to the server who seats you and that will be the server who brings out your food.

Even when I went during an off hour, I waited on line for twenty minutes. I did not see nearly the same lines during the weekdays I passed by.

Signs are all over stating that waiters/waitresses do not accept a tip.  Weird seeing that they do bring over the food after you place your order.  The guy that served us was attentive and made sure our drinks were full and that we enjoyed our food.  Would've liked to have tipped him for the great service but didn't want him to get into trouble if someone saw me tip him.

I opted for the Ferdi's special as I'm not a huge fan of seafood and it is offered in 2 sizes, the regular or 2/3's.

Throw on a little hot sauce or even better some of their chili vinegar to add a spice to it.  The sandwich was good, my only complaint would be that I would've enjoyed this sandwich more if only it were served hot.

I also had to try their famous bread pudding (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iSRTaT9WngzB8JJ2YKJUig?select=rWH7ERx4q6Ewb2kRAyWs0A).  A tasty variation to your normal bread pudding.  Was good but once again, I wished it was warmed before serving.

Of all the casual restaurants in New Orleans, Mother's is at the top of my list.  Sure, it's well-known and more of a clich√© when it comes to diner-style dining in New Orleans.  But, there's a reason that Mother's is on top-- the food is tasty!  

I always stop in Mother's every time I visit New Orleans, and, on this last trip, Vinny and I stopped in twice!  Once for breakfast and once for a late night dinner. On the 1st visit, I had Mae's omelet, which is made with Black Forest Ham. At first, I was caught off guard by the because the omelet had a hint of sweetness, but then I realized that the ham was cooked with a brown sugar caramelized crust (think along the lines of Honey Baked Ham). It was quite good. That morning, Vinny ordered the Crawfish √âtouff√©e omelet, which was a simple egg omelet smothered in the classic creole crawfish concoction. He let me try it, and I must say, it was quite tasty!  Another stand-out of this visit were the biscuits, which we gobbled down smothered in Mother's berry preserves!

On our 2nd visit, Vinny and I ordered a Roast Beef Po-Boy, Red Beans, and Rice, and Bread Pudding. The Red Beans and Rice were amazing, but the Po-Boy and Bread Pudding were bland to me. I wish we had ordered the Ham Po-Boy instead. I'm sure it would have been tasty with the Black Forest Ham!

I opted for the waffle ($7.25) with the additional blueberry topping (+$2.00) and a side of the ""famous"" black ham (+$2.50) and, of course, a coffee. 
The waffle with the blueberry and the syrup can only really be defined as comfort food: it wasn't too sweet (mind you, don't douse your waffle in the pot of syrup they give you, I found dipping it to be just right!) and it was just the right size. The black ham (which is the ""caramelized outside"" of their famous baked ham) was just OK, nothing spectacular. In fact, I found the baked ham (which my boyfriend ordered) to be a touch too salty, albeit tender, for me.
The coffee, though... oh, that coffee... I'm going have dreams about the coffee. One of the best I've had during my stay in New Orleans (beating that of Cafe du Monde & French Market coffee, though rivalling that of Cafe Beignet).

You can go to any place in the city (of New Orleans) and get a similar dish with more seafood for a cheaper price with the same quality of taste, if not better. 

1. Seafood platter...is like half the size of most platters I encounter around the city. The fry itself is average. It's just about location.

2. Gumbo. Never been a fan. And this dish is just average.

3. Red beans and rice (as a side dish). Pretty weak in my opinion. Popeyes is better. And what's better than these two? Freakin' Blue Runners (in a can at your local grocery store). Those beans in a can is sicktastic -- so good with just the twist of a can opener.

4. Bread Pudding? Okay. This thing is LEGIT. I ain't a fan of bread pudding but this place does it right. It's like God created this before Adam and Eve took their place. It's like an aphrodisiac in your mouth that even Bacchus fell prey to the ecstasy that lay before him...with its bit of raisins and a hint of rum just massaging the oh-so-goodness in your mouth. I should just give this place a FIVE for their rum cake but dang the average food for a high price. Three stars for you.

My Opinion/Story:
Not knowing much about the places in New Orleans and during my pre-Yelp time, I would like to say that it was meant in my lucky stars that I discover the goodness that of Mother's!  I was in ""Nawleans"" for business reasons and my hotel happens to be close to Mother's.  Not having the guts to venture further away, my co-worker and I walked around to places that seemed safe.  Long lines outside the restaurant is always a good indication that the place serves good food.  We were so hungry that we decided to just go for it.  This is also my first time to try Louisiana cooking.  

As we slowly moved along the line, we watch how people ordered and what they ordered.  We can even see some people eating their food and the smell and sight just made my mouth water even more.  Lucky for me, everything in the menu is edible and seafood is their main dish.  Prices are reasonable and the portions are huge.

I ordered the Catfish Po 'Boys, Crawfish Etouffee, and their Seafood Gumbo (company is paying for my dinner).  I didn't finish my food but for me it was heavenly.  I don't think any other Cajun places I've been to can compare to Mother's dishes.  The sandwich is fresh and the bread is soft.  The crawfish etouffee was my favorite and I've never had anyplace better.  The seafood gumbo was just to die for.  I really can't believe how unique yet fulfilling cajun food can be.  It just makes you feel like you're home when you eat them.  I just wish I can go back to New Orleans just to have another bite of real cajun food.  The restaurant is a bit small but has quite a character.  Additional rooms you didn't think exists and brick walls that made you realize how old and authentic the place really is.  This is one of the places I plan to visit again before I'm too old to travel.",2010-02-06 03:22:07,30.0,1930,30.0,0.08,0.08,0.6828771804089782,0.6828771804089782

4) Stand with receipt in hand as someone will take notice of you, seat you at a table and serve you your food

For $12, that sandwich better be a great cold sandwich.

 No one working there was nice at all. Completely rude. I ordered pecan pie and then asked for a fork.

How about this: know what you're in for. This place is typically packed, at all hours, and is extremely famous for cheap food served fast. It is tiny, divey, and constantly overrun with tourists. 

if you are a tourist, be prepared to stand in a line 10-20 people deep just to get in the door, then another 10 person line to order. if you need a table, be prepared to stand and wait for one to become available. Yes, it really is that busy. 

Or better yet, schedule your visit to Mother's at on off-hour. At least that way you might only have to stand in the line inside (not out in the heat or torrential rain, yes I have seen people doing both). 

The food is really tasty. This is definitely one of the places where you can pack on some serious pounds if you're not careful. Everything is delicious and made the most ""full-flavored"" way (to use the new P.C. marketing term). 

Prices are stupid-low for New Orleans, but they make up for it in volume. As fast-paced as some bars, Mother's is good for a ""got the t-shirt"" type of visit for a local, but I wouldn't suggest it for a regular meal out.

Seafood Gumbo- 3 Stars. Nothing out of the ordinary here. Solid but ordinary.

Crawfish Etouffee- 5 Stars(6 if possible)! By far the best dish I had here! I loved this dish! The mixture of spices and vegetables were combined perfectly with the seafood broth and crawfish and shrimp! I could eat this dish everyday all day........ YUM!

Jerry's Jambalaya- 4 Stars! Spices were just right on this dish. If it weren't for the Etouffee being so good(and taking up all my stomach space) this probably would of gotten 5 stars.

1/2 Fried Chicken w Cabbage and Fries- 4 Stars. Fried Chicken was nicely cooked! Juicy and tasted great! The fries were ordinary..... nothing special! The cabbage was delicious! I don't know how they made it (maybe an abundance of butter) but I devoured this side dish with minimal sharing.

I was in NOLA a few weeks ago and had the pleasure to try several restaurants. The first night I was in New Orleans, I visited Mother's.

I tried the Debris with pork sandwich at Mothers. It was good. Was it as amazing as I had heard.... well no. I liken Mother's to Phillipe's French Dip sandwich in LA. It's a place you need to visit when you are in the city, but in terms of a fantastic meal that is beyond anything you have ever tasted, it certainly falls short. Perhaps I lack the sophisticated taste buds of so many fans of Mother's, but the flavors did not seem complicated or exceptional in any way. My memory of the sandwich was that of a fairly salty sandwich with a good amount of meat. Nothing really interesting. I actually did not eat my entire sandwich due to the saltiness of the meat. I gave the large remainder to my colleague to finish. I have had much better sandwiches than this in places that are much more obscure. To say the least I was disappointed.
Food: 2/5

If it were not for the fact that it is a fairly famous place in NOLA, I would say Mother's is kind of a boring restaurant. The restaurant has brick walls and a cafeteria style counter. The walls have pictures of people and places and reminded me of an Applebee's. Maybe Mother's was different before it became a tourist destination, but it really has no character in my opinion. It looks like a tourist trap. All that's missing is a giftshop counter.... oh wait there is one..... With all criticism aside, the restaurant is clean and the management has worked to make it family friendly and amiable.
Atmosphere: 3/5

For myself, Mother's was an acceptable value. It was a big sandwich, and I couldn't even finish it. The price was not wallet busting, but it wasn't an everyday meal either. Personally, I think you can get better value at other places, but Mother's is acceptable and hence average.
Value: 3/5

I had no problem nor exceptions to the service. The servers themselves did not seem too happy, but then again it was fairly late -- and I'm sure they have to deal with plenty of drunk idiots late at night. Aside from that Mother's is a fairly self serve/pay-at-the-counter sort of place. So service may not even be applicable.
Service: N/A

Overall I was not impressed by Mother's. I'm not a connoisseur of finer Louisiana cuisine, so I don't have the taste buds to distinguish the difference between layers of salt. In my opinion, I think excessive salt use is a sign of poor quality and lazy flavoring, but many true Americans would disagree. I am sure in future visits to NOLA I will be returning to Mother's when other people I am traveling with demand it. I will, however, not expect much because I now know it is almost all hype mixed with a heaping bowl of salt.",2012-08-02 02:38:51,20.0,2780,20.0,0.04024144869215292,0.04024144869215292,0.37932162090544075,0.37932162090544075

The food was average, and I went with a group so had a fair sampling of most everything, and the gumbo was super not awesome.

Based on that lone, I'd give it 3 stars, but what really put me off of this place was the atmosphere. The staff members were all uniformly rude; they barked at people, told them to ""hurry up"" when ordering, and not a single person out of four people responded to me when I said hello or thank you or asked a question. I'm from Tennessee and was put off that they advertise themselves as super Southern or home-y, given not only the clear lack of hospitality but the weird sense of hostility on top of that. Minus 1 star.

Minus the next star: The staff in here, while not all of them, cursed quite a bit. I'm talking your Bs, your Fs, and then the ultimate: the N-word! Why would you talk like this openly in front of customers?? I want to eat your allegedly good food! I don't want to hear you talking about B. A. Ns!! Good lord!!

After I went there and swore never to return, I passed it the next evening while walking south on Poydras. A manager-looking person had taken a female employee outside, seemingly to hear her version of some sort of fight that took place. They were both standing on the entrance ramp to the restaurant and not moving out of the way for potential customers, essentially barricading the place. The female employee was going on about how she doesn't F'ing lie, and the manager was just nodding in this weird sort of sympathy. Behind them, a third employee also on the ramp just smoked. Two customers came out to leave and actually had to wait for these people to scram.

Once inside, our expectations were shattered. The staff was extremely pushy and yelled at a few customers because they were in a walkway or sat at a table before ordering. Everything was very chaotic and clearly the place was filled with tourists so you'd expect the staff to be a bit nicer and more helpful.  Instead, everyone was rolling their eyes and acting like you were wasting their time.
After making it to the register and not receiving a single greeting, we ordered a shrimp po boy, creole shrimp omelet, cup of jambalaya and a cup of etouffee. ..totaling to $47!!! 
We went and sat a table and received our food shortly after. The jambalaya was decent, the etouffee fishy, a lackluster po boy and an absolutely disgusting and chewy omelette.

PARKING: Metered parking is free on weekends and there were plenty of spaces close by so no trouble finding parking.

WAIT: We got there around 9:30am and there were only a few other people in front of us. You have to wait in line and then they'll ask you how many you have in your party.  When everyone is there you can go inside and line up to order.  Then, you can find your own able.  The restaurant looks small at first but you have to go towards the back where there are tons of round tables for bigger groups.

Ordering is fast so know what you want when you get up there.

When you are done ordering go to your table with your receipt.  A waiter or waitress will come, take your receipts and give you utinsels and bring the food to your table when it is ready.

FOOD:
BREAKFAST SPECIAL - it comes with grits, 2 eggs, biscuit and choice of meat.  They have regular ham, blackened ham, sausage, debris...I got the blackened ham because it has a caramelized black crust on the outside that makes the ham tasty and fatty.  It almost tasted like roasted duck to me.  The regular ham doesn't have that outside ""crust"" part.  Debris tasted like pot roast or beef stew to me as it was shredded meat in a sauce.  The sausage was actually really good and fairly tasty.  The grits are basically mushy rice porridge with no flavor.  I think the point is to eat it with the meat since it is so salty.  The biscuit was OK - it was kind of dry.

Overall, interesting to try the ham and a southern breakfast but not something that blew me away.",2015-06-03 03:52:15,7.0,1708,7.0,0.021148036253776436,0.021148036253776436,0.16937687147353955,0.16937687147353955

While we are waiting the people behind the counter are cursing at one another and being extremely disrespectful towards one another. Speaking about each other's children? All of this is in front of customers! Extremely unprofessional. Also before a certain time crawfish √©touff√©e is not available despite the fact you can get crawfish √©touff√©e omelet? Um okay. We finally go ahead and pay in cash since they are so technologically behind. Also before I even got my change, she was taking the next person's order.

In spite of it's longstanding ties with the city, Mother's is not without a certain amount of controversy.  I had a couple of strong recommendations to go there from some friends and co-workers back in Seattle, but I had quite a few locals that I had met that told me not to bother going there.  In Mother's defense none of the no votes said anything disparaging about the food.  No, those complaints were more focused on the fact that Mother's had become such a tourist destination and, therefore, was very crowded. They do have a point.  You'd do well to get here well before noon.  Lunch is incredibly busy and seating is limited.  If the weather's nice, you might want to considering ordering to go and maybe scoring a park bench at the nearby Lafayette Square. That of course depends on what you're ordering.  My first time here I ordered the Roast Beef Po' Boy with Debris and that wasn't going anywhere, but to the nearest table.

They use the standard, light and airy, Italian roll for their Po' Boys at Mother's.  The bottom half of the split roll is slathered in classic American yellow mustard, which came as a surprise to me, but wasn't an unwelcome one. Then comes some coleslaw and that, in turn, is topped with sliced roast beef which then gets a healthy layer of debris and, finally, some gravy. The gravy is more jus than gravy, but it has a nice beefy flavor.  It's a huge sandwich.  They have a smaller version and I kind of regret not ordering it.  It's a good sandwich, too.  I wasn't blown away by it, the roast beef was a bit dry, but I ate the whole damn thing.  So, that tells you something.  In turns out that the debris is the best part of the sandwich. It's tender and full of flavor.  It's also available as an addition to almost any sandwich on their menu.  Which is pretty smart.

I'm originally from California, but I'm living in the Southern region. I had to finally try this place!

I excepted it to be a sit-down-joint and order from a menu...little did I know! We stood in line outside that extended passed the building and waited for nearly 1.5 hours until we were able to order our food. We went towards the end of July 2010. It was 89 degrees with nearly 100% humidity for a heat index of 101! It was a cafeteria style line and cashier. Once we ordered our food, we chose our table then shortly after a waiter took our receipt to gather our food then brought it to us.

My wife had ""Ralph (Ferdi w/ cheese) Po-Boy"" and I had the ""Combination plate (Jerry's Jambalaya, Crawfish Ettoufee, red beans, and vegetables) with a cup of Seafood Gumbo""

I did not find their Ralph was as good as I've heard or read, but their ""debris"" sauce that it came with was fantastic. Once added to the sandwich, it over-powered everything. The Jambalaya was not as spicy as I imagined but was very flavorful. The ettoufee was also good, but we made chicken ettoufee after watching Tyler's Ultimate of New Orleans.

This place is supposedly legendary. But like most legends, there doesn't seem to be much truth to this one. 

Usually when you see a long line up to a hole in the wall, you know you are in for something good. How much I wanted that to be true for Mother's. For starters, everything is bland from the ""World Famous"" ham (add 'infamously dry' to that description) to the red beans and rice. We ended up going to another restaurant to eat after because whatever we did consume was out of hunger and not enjoyment.

We stopped in here knowing nothing about the place. There wasn't a line outside since it was only 8 am, but the line inside took about 15 minutes. Hubby stood in line while I waited at a table with Thing 1 and Thing 2. Everyone around us looked so happy, I was just sure this would be a great experience!

Nope. After you sit, the ""servers"" (quotes because they don't serve at all.. bring food, MAYBE, but not serve) ask for your receipt and bring your beverages. That is, if you're lucky. Hubby was given two waters while he was waiting in line, and that was all we got until after our food arrived and we asked for our coffees and milk for Thing 1. She looked at our receipt 3 times to make sure we were actually supposed to have coffee! How rude.. it's coffee!

They brought our food and didn't so much as acknowledge the fact that we said thank you numerous times. We literally never had a person come to our table after the food was ""served"". Not once. 

On to the food.. and let me tell you, the food is the only reason there are even two star up there. The biscuits were perfect. I love homemade buttermilk biscuits, and these tasted exactly like Mom's. The grits were very good, the sausage was tasty and the pancakes were worth the $3. The Debris was nothing more than soggy, greasy roast beef, but Hubby liked it on his biscuit. He got the Shrimp Creole omelette and said he would have been happier with the ham and cheese, but he figured, ""When in Rome..""

Overall, while good, our breakfast was not worth $38. Lucky for me, I didn't feel like tipping ANYTHING to the ""servers"", so there wasn't anything to add to that $38.

I'd never been there before and failed to read the yelp suggestions on the establishments layout so I didn't know what to do upon entering. I went around 9am and the hustle and flow had already departed. I sat down at a table thinking someone would come take my order. It took another patron to tell me that orders are placed at the register. Note to establishment...hire a hostess to help your tourist that want to support your business and make sure he/she can smile at everyone as they walk in. The breakfast special was the usual breakfast...eggs cooked to preference, grits, biscuit that didn't look too appealing but was light, and melted in the mouth with their preserves, your choice of meat. I went with the black ham and it was awesome! Once I figured out the lay of the land with the establishment, I guess you could say the staff was friendly...attentive...i never went without needing something....The Cafe au Lait was good ..no need to walk down a few more blocks for a du monde. I returned for dinner and got the Famous Ferdi special.....now that was an awesome po'boy...you must experience the debris ....it makes all the difference. The gumbo was solid. Had a bloody mary that I questioned whether any liquor was in it until I couldn't see straight so that was right on time. I had to get another for the road!!! I'd go here again, most definitely. Aside from needing a hostess that understands the definition of greeting tourist that patronize the business and  the paycheck, this is a cool dive in my book! By the way, the cashier, Waneisha, was as pleasant as she could be with a smile. I couldn't remember the name of the po'boy i wanted and went into describing it to her...she was patient and told me the name without making me feel like a fool.

The day I walk out of your divey dining room without that way-too-full feeling will be the day I know I have lost my youthful recklessness.  At present I enjoy every part of your breakfast spread, including the uncomfortable first few blocks out the door, while everything is still settling down.

What could make me eat this irresponsibly? Well, for starters, this restaurant knows the true meaning of breakfast.  As in, a generous portion of meat: spicy pork sausage, baked ham (ask for the blackened ends, which are bursting with clovey flavor) or my personal favorite, a thick stew of tender beef called ""debris and gravy.""  Served with two eggs, a pile of grits AND a biscuit (you don't have to choose; you get both!)  

Try as we might, we've never been able to order anything but breakfast here; it's just so perfect, from the mimosas (with fresh-squeezed orange juice) to the homemade raspberry jam and real yellow butter on the biscuit at the end.  I have, however, tried their gumbo, which is fantastic, and I have heard tales of their fantastic po-boys.  And once I had a bite of an ethereal pecan pie.  

The atmosphere here is unique: you wait in a long line to order, find yourself a table and a runner brings your food when it's ready.  A sign proclaims that the staff doesn't accept tips, but I've never seen them turn one down (this bothers me a little.  Why say it if you don't enforce it?)  They are lots of fun, though -- outspoken and sassy, but more fun than rude.  Plenty of local flavor here, in more ways than one.

If you have ever had a cheesesteak from Pat's or Jim's in Philly, or one from Texadelphia in Austin, or a French Dip from Phillippe's in LA, then you will understand how bad Mother's is. 

The folks are rude. Immediately after we ordered, while I was handing the cashier my money, she was yelling at the person behind me to begin ordering. Then she yelled at us to move aside - only there wasn't anywhere to move to, since there were people waiting for their coffee to my right.

Then, when I got to the drinks lady, she said they had just run out of coffee. At 10:00 AM? Ok, poor task planning. Then she tells me to come back in 10 minutes. I thought I heard wrong and asked her to repeat that. Yes, apparently at Mother's, unlike everywhere else in the Universe, it takes 10 minutes to brew more coffee. 

The famous biscuits? Flaky, yes. Overly salted, yes. And, shockingly, the grits are QUICK GRITS. Yes, they are the same crappy grits you get at the grocery store.

And the po-boy? I am sure that they don't use Leidenheimer bread, the famed gold standard of po-boy bread from New Orleans. And the meat was pretty tasteless. 

Folks, this is not a great sandwich. The attitude was absolutely ""You should feel privileged to give us your money and get crappy, rude service and mediocre food"". You, my friend, deserve better food and service than this.

DO NOT PASS on the softshell crab po'boy.  I can't emphasize that enough.  It's delicious, and my co-worker kept saying ""I literally can't put this down"" while she was eating it.  Sooo tasty.  Fried to perfection, soft bread, a handful of shredded lettuce, tomato....you really can't go wrong with this.

Tip: Don't ask for substitutions on anything.  The gentleman in front of us asked if he could switch out coffee for some OJ, and the cashier said ""no"" in the most serious tone.

I personally have always found it to be one of the most over-rated restaurants in the city. The food is just average. The seating system is terrible: Customers have to stand outside in a long line until they are allowed inside to stand in yet another line to order. All the while only about half the tables are occupied. Since you take your own order, seat yourself, and pay right after you order, there is no waitstaff, only busboys, who may or may not fill drinks, etc. The bathrooms are always extremely dirty. The list goes on. Why anyone would choose this place over the hundreds of wonderful restaurants in NOLA is a mystery to me. But I've always been amenable to taking my guests anyway, because the place is famous for some reason.

No more. My family wanted to eat at Mother's while they were here for Memorial Day weekend this year, so we went. The food was no better than usual. Some of my family members liked theirs; mine was so so; my mother didn't even finish her po-boy because the bread was too soggy to eat. 

Then as we were finishing dinner, the busboy came up to my sister, who had paid the bill, and told her the NO TIPPING policy that is posted all over the restaurant is ""for tax purposes only"" and that she should feel free to tip. This, in my opinion, was very uncool. It was awkward for my sister. The restaurant needs to have one policy and make sure its staff sticks to it. And frankly if the purpose of the no tipping policy is tax evasion, then I want no part of it.

But that was not the worst part. After the busboy had cleared the table, he turned to another busboy and said, the ""f******* bitch didn't leave a tip""--all while my sister and 4-year-old niece were still standing there. 

Needless to say, neither I nor any of my future guests will be patronizing Mother's again.",2013-05-26 06:35:00,-9.0,1915,9.0,-0.025280898876404494,0.025280898876404494,-0.20566392520456353,0.20566392520456353

Who are these people?  

It's your classic greasy spoon cafeteria for the locals, tourists, suits and families. It's a must come (with no expectations) for the young at heart and food driven. It is not for someone who can't wait outside in a line for 30 minutes, or handle looking for a table on their own, or who can't handle the cashier passing on a smile. 

I stood in line for less than 20 minutes, got thrown in line, ordered the Ferdi Po'boy, seafood platter with crawfish etouffee, gumbo and fried shrimp, and the hot links to round it all out. I probably had every other person in that restaurant stop and drool to ask what we ordered. Guess we got it right....

And so does Mother's...the food alone (including the perfectly disorganized layout and aesthetics) put me in Cajun country and at home with NOLA's history. Some lady, could have been a supervisor or shift manager, would come by every so often throughout our meal and check on us, spark a conversation, smile, give a little shoulder tap--really made us feel at home.

I loved it. Maybe I don't have high expectations, but the place does work.

If you can swing it, go at an off-time. I went at 5 pm and there were plenty of tables and no line. Twenty minutes later, there were 15 people in line. Everyone I interacted with was very nice.

Enter from the door facing Poydras. Pick up a menu to your right. (It helps to look at the menu online beforehand.) When ready, go the the cash register (or get in line) to order and pay. Cash or cards.

I ordered the fried chicken with red beans and rice and fries as my two sides. They warn you that the fried chicken takes 30 minutes, but since I went early, it took 20 minutes. I also got a roast beef po'boy.

I was not surprised or upset the po'boy was sitting in its juice, as another reviewer was. I've had similar presentations elsewhere. If this bothers you, ask to have the juice in a cup. The beef was moist and plentiful. Next time I would first pull off the top and distribute the toppings/condiments a little more evenly before snarfing down.

If you get fried chicken, remember it just came out of the fryer, so it's going to be really hot! (Duh.) I was really hungry and reason went out the window and I didn't take that into consideration. But it was good - crispy-coated, juicy inside,  and seasoned well. At other soul food places I've been disappointed by bland, unseasoned fried chicken.

The fries were fine. The mild red beans and rice were a bit weak. They lacked flavor (and I don't mean spiciness). There was a large biscuit rounding out the fried chicken dinner. Not a cat's head, but still good-sized.

When you're done, head out the door opposite to where you came in from, at the corner of Poydras and Tchoupitoulas. The line was getting longer as I was leaving, and things were getting tense.

It's recommended for tourists, and I even had friends recommend this place to me.  It sounded like exactly what I would love - an old diner type place with delicious creole food. And a few blocks from my hotel and some of the sites I was seeing too!  Well, the old historical atmosphere is definitely there and I enjoyed sitting there, and the staff were all super nice, but I found the food much blander than I was expecting in terms of spice and flavour, and really not cheap - I ordered the combination plate, and it was $20.  With the bad CAD to USD exchange rate right now, back home, that would get me amazing food at all sorts of good places for lunch.  I ate it all (did not find the portions too huge in New orleans, like in other places in the US), so it wasn't bad, but nothing really exciting.  Good chunks of chicken in the jambalaya (one thing I wanted to try while in New Orleans) but was pretty plain.  I chose crawfish √©touff√©e (I think the other choice was shrimp creole, which I had tried already at The Gumbo Shop, which I didn't love there, but I did really enjoy the gumbo there).  For the side, I chose the green beans with tomato which was okay, but not really my thing since I'm used to green beans that are barely cooked (bright green/fresh tasting/slightly crisp), so I could have chosen a better side.  Was thrown off by it being called ""Jerry's"" as that usually means it's someone's special recipe, so I thought they would be more flavourful.  Red beans and rice were fine.  Potato salad was soft and creamy without a lot of texture, so I think it was good, but I really didn't like how all the other dishes were touching it on the plate.  Everything was all kind of luke warm (instead of potato salad being cold, and the other dishes being hot).  And it was all the same soft texture, which I realize is part of the style of the food, but all of the options for sides are all very soft, so no contrast available (and with a big combination plate, you're unlikely to want to order additional food).  Wish I had ordered a po' boy, but I was trying to order things that I wouldn't be able to get back home, and I can get and make pretty good sandwiches at home.  I had the sweet potato pie because I don't think I've ever had it before, and it was fine.  When I walked in, I didn't realize there was a huge room of tables so i sat in the same room where you order the food and it was fine, but you might want to check out the other side too when you are choosing where to sit.  I would go back if I was right in the area looking for food, and I would order something else, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go there (and I honestly don't think I'd specifically recommend it to anyone if asked where to eat in New Orleans.  Maybe that would be different if I had ordered a Po' boy, but I don't tend to recommend restaurants that have any disappointing dishes).",2017-05-22 17:42:42,62.0,2975,62.0,0.10562180579216354,0.10562180579216354,1.136706136314982,1.136706136314982

There is nothing fancy about the restaurant decor or the food; just good homestyle Cajun/Creole.  Don't be intimidated by the lines out the door; I've never had to wait more than 15 minutes to order. 

 I've never done dinner at Mothers, but here are my favorites for breakfast and lunch:

BREAKFAST
=  Crawfish Etouffee Omelete - served with grits and biscuit
=  Breakfast Special - scrambled eggs with homemade sausage, grits, biscuit, coffee or OJ

LUNCH
=  Jambalaya Plate - sausage and chicken; (greens are a great side dish)
=  Red Beans and Rice - sausage and ham
=  Ferdie Special Po' Boy - the debris makes the sandwich
=  Roast Beef Po' Boy - not as good as the Ferdi Special, but still awesome
=  ANYTHING that has their ham as an incredient... incredibly delicious.

DESSERT
=  Sweet Potato Pie - unbelievable
=  Bread Pudding 

Helpful Tips:
=  Know what you want to order before you get to the cashier.  They are all business.
=  Unless you are incredibly hungry, a 2/3 size Po' Boy is more than enough for most people. 
=  If possible, have one of your party find a table while the rest order their food.  
=  Find a table after you order then put the receipt on the table so that the waitress knows what to bring you.

We came here around 9:30AM, and was so disappointed to find that a lot of their famous dishes aren't available until 10:30AM!! Definitely wish I would've known when I was reading those Yelp reviews! We got a Famous Ferdi Po'boy to share between my boyfriend and myself, since we couldn't order the other food. I normally isn't a fan of po'boy, but I got to admit that it was pretty good. Their ham though.. it was just whatever to me. 

After sharing the Ferdi po'boy.. we walked around the area for a while to digest the food we just ate, and to wait till 10:30AM because we wanted to give the food another chance. Since we were super full from the po'boy, we ordered a Crawfish Etouffee to share. THAT DID NOT DISAPPOINT. IT WAS THE BEST. We got red beans and rice, and cabbage as our sides. The crawfish etouffee itself was so good, and had so many crawfish on it!!! It was one of the best dishes I had in NOLA.

Be prepared to stand in line, but the actual process of ordering, finding a seat, and receiving the food is on par and often better than a sit down restaurant. We were referred to Mother's by other visitors to NOLA. 

Food ordered: a order of the red beans and rice with hot smoked sausage, turnip greens, and potato salad and a order of the 2/3 Ferdi PoBoy. Unsweetened tea to drink. It totaled to almost $30, but with no tip (if that's your thing).

All in all, very good food. The turnip greens were delicious and the much boasted Ferdi PoBoy lived up to its reputation. The rice used in the red beans and rice was had that very bland, over starchy taste too it, but the red bean gravy was good. Sausage was very good as well but has a typical taste one could find at market. Next time (and there will be one) I'll skip on the potato salad and just order French fries. 

Onto service: you must know what you want by the time you reach the end of the line. The cashier is very matter of fact with you and will not put up with anyone slowing down the line. She about bit the guy-in-front of-me's head off for trying to order the Two Egg Breakfast special as a one egg special and trying to argue with her about it. She did miss hear my husband's order of lemonade to drink as a tea with lemon.

Cash and credit cards are accepted. 

To continue, once you order, you find a seat. My husband and I found a small little two-top in the next room. It was comfortably cool. The server came to the table and took out receipt. In about ten minutes, she returned with our food. Tea refills are allowed, but you have to ask. 

Best thing: Ferdi PoBoy and the Turnip Greens. I could of ate a huge plate of those turnip greens and drank a cup of that turnip juice.

Prices are quite reasonable and the food comes in great quantity.  I definitely recommend having something with ham in it.  They say it is the ""world's best ham"" and they can't be too far off.  Also, the blueberry muffin with pecans is wonderful.

One night we walked in just after a bus of N. Carolina college students.  They started ordering and $854 order later was our turn.  We were hungry and it was our last night in NOLA so we stayed and ordered figuring we would have a wait for the food.  Sure we saw tray after tray leave the kitchen and go the the back room where the gals were seated but our food came within 15 minutes (fresh fried seafood).  They can handle a long line and keep the quality up.

5 stars does not mean they don't do some things better then other things.
Ferdi Sandwich: 5+ Stars
Ralph Sandwich: 5+ Stars (not traditional but yum)
Shrimp Po-Boy: 5+ stars
Fried seafood platter: 4.5 stars  (too much food to finish)
Gumbo: 4 stars (solid but better available in NOLA)
Shrimp Creole: 4.5 stars
Etouffee: 5+ stars (this was one of the best we had all week)
Jambalaya: 4+ stars
Greens: 4+
Fried oysters: 5 stars
Fried shrimp: 5+ stars
Fried fish: 4 stars
Pecan Pie: 4.5 stars

Process:
Get in line (inside or out, the line moves quick)
Grab a menu (available when you are 12 feet from ordering (just before the first steam table on the left)
Figure out the meal
Order and pay at the register
Grab drinks and sit with receipt
Someone will view or take the receipt at the table (so they can find where to take the food)
5-15 minutes later food arives, ask then if you need sauce or anything
Eat and enjoy

Take away is also great from here espiecially the po-boys and pie!",2011-01-02 20:46:48,35.0,2430,35.0,0.07972665148063782,0.07972665148063782,0.710010722691882,0.710010722691882

As you enter there's a man at the door that just instructs you to head toward the cash register. During that time if you're not a regular you have to pick something to eat quickly.

After ordering, you have to find a table. Make sure you don't lose your recipe. You give the recipe to the wait-person and they somehow find your order. Not the most harmonious means of service.

We ordered pancakes and the shrimp creole omelete. The pancakes tasted a bit overseasoned. It tasted salty. The portions were pretty generous. 

My omelete showed a little more promise. But after an initial bite it showed that the creole was made with canned tomatoes. I was expecting a thicker broth. It was a bit more watery and bland than i would have preferred.

The only good part of the meal was the biscuits. It's giving the review an extra star. The biscuits tasted very soft and buttery and fresh. The biscuit did have issues staying together. It was really soft though.

The biscuits was paired with some weird purple jam. I'm guessing that's grape.

There was a line out the door and around the building at 2, so we knew the place had to be great. Food was fresh and tasted great with quick turn around after ordering. My only complaint - and this maybe my fault - was that we weren't aware of how the system worked and assumed it's like every other restaurant. It's not. You wait outside in the line (which moves pretty quickly), then wait in the counter line to order. Know what you want prior to getting to the register as those ladies are not messing around. After you order & pay, you take your receipt to the dining room and sit down where your server will collect it, and go back to get your food. She wasn't messing around either. It can be confusing if you've never been there before, and there's not a lot of patience by the staff to explain it either. Also be aware that there's no tipping allowed per signs posted all over the restaurant.

I guess my general sense is that Mother's is a good name for this place.  It's nothing exceptionally good and if you want some New Orleans food it's as good a place as many others.  But it was certainly nothing special and the prices were not particularly good either.  I suspect they thrive based on their location far from the French Quarter and surrounded by many hotels.

The way things work at this restaurant, at least for lunch, is you order and pay at the register then find a seat. A waiter/waitress then addresses your presence by taking your receipt which has your order on it. They take off and get your food. Soon after, your dishes have arrived.

Cool thing was when I was eating Ludacris the rapper/actor walked in with his friends, but shortly walked out for a reason I don't know.

We weren't sure how the restaurant worked and I understand that the wait staff is trained to handle masses of people but ordering dinner was a stressful experience even though the restaurant was half empty lol. We needed a moment to decide what we wanted to order and the cashier was pretty pushy and impatient (but we didn't get too frazzled and tried to keep up with her). We decided on the chicken dinner/special and the Famous Ferdi, grabbed our waters and sat down. The chicken was delicious and the sides (green beans, rice & beans) complemented it well. The poboy was a good size for two people to split but I didn't think it was worth the hype at all. It ended up being really messy and wet for me personally and I couldn't really taste the meat. I knew that I wanted to stop by Mother's during my visit to New Orleans to see what made it so famous/popular but won't be going out of my way to stop by the next time I'm in town.

I can see why this place is a NOLA institution.  The food is really tasty and their queue management is amazing.  When we arrived the line extended from the door to the back of the building but we only waited about 10-15 minutes.  They had a gentleman at the front door letting folks in in bunches to keep the line inside just full enough to keep things moving. 

The service is efficient and our waiter was attentive enough (brought our food quickly and refilled our water several times).  

We had the Ralph Special (i.e. Famous Ferdi Special with cheese, because cheese makes just about EVERYTHING better).  It was very tasty and there was plenty of it, but there was actually a little less meat than I expected (esp. given how Adam Richman GUSHED over the size of it on Man v. Food).   The best part was DEFINITELY the debris (so much so, that my husband headed back the next day for a Debris Po Boy).

We also had the smoked sausage po-boy since they were out of hot sausage :(   It was very good and I kicked it toward hot some of their pepper sauce.  This one actually had MORE meat than I expected.  So I guess between the two, it all balanced out.  :D

We finished up with their bread pudding which includes fruit cocktail as a bit of a twist.  I thought it was very good, but I wouldn't say it's the best I've ever had (I am a fan of bread pudding and make a pretty good one at home if I do say so myself, so I'm kinda picky in this area).  However, the buttery sauce was worth the price of the dish.  And best of all, the recipe for both is on their website, so I can try making this one myself.

It's a cute, homely place, with a mostly pleasant wait staff, and was actually the first taste I ever got of the city (yes, I'm one of the few who came here sober). The problem really is that their signature items just aren't really that impressive, at least not as much as they were when they first became famous for them, so you build this ideal up that will inevitably be shattered.

That was certainly the case for me with their famous ""Ralph"" sandwich, consisting of baked ham, roast beef, gravy, cheese, and something they call ""debris"", which is essentially the juicy run-off that you get from the roast beef as it's cooking. In theory this should be an overly indulgent and somewhat hedonistic pleasure-pile of meats with enough wetness to make it go down super easy. It falls short on the meat, and comes up extra on the soggy, to just leave you feeling a little limp.

The real problem is that the main components of this legendary sandwich are just all a bit bland in their own individual roles, so combining them together doesn't really bring out the desired effect. I mean, just look at the bread and cheese (http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/3582970601/) ...it doesn't get much more basic than that in the culinary world. The ham (which has become famous in its own right) was the one saving grace, providing a pack of a punch that I wish the roast beef had followed up with. But the biggest disappointment was this debris that is so hailed as the secret ingredient that makes the whole thing worth ordering. It just added very little whatsoever, other than dampening the bread, which I suppose was a good thing since it was so plain.

It's a good, filling meal, and if you time it right you won't have to suffer through the touristically torturous long lines. The price is pretty fair for what you get, by New Orleans standards, so if you really must check this one off your list at least it isn't too much of an inconvenience. Perhaps the real gem is in the other parts of the menu, waiting to be discovered, but this time around the hype just wasn't backed up.",2012-02-22 18:28:23,36.0,2263,36.0,0.09045226130653267,0.09045226130653267,0.7567635813019649,0.7567635813019649

When you talk to any person who's lived in the Big Easy and ask them where you should eat, 9/10 of them will most likely recommend Mother's. Mother's is an all-day restaurant that's been around here in NOLA for a very long time. People will come here as early as 7am when it opens for breakfast, until as late as 10 pm when it closes for a last minute dinner. 

Since Mother's was hyped so heavily by my coworkers, I decided to venture out to this place and make it my first taste of ""real"" Southern food. Mother's is located on Poydras Street and only about a 5-10 minute walk from Canal Street. And so it's super convenient to get to if you are staying at one of the major hotels downtown. 

When I got there around 7pm on a Wednesday, the place was pretty packed. My coworker told me it was like cafeteria style food, and it kind of seemed like it. The food was found in little bins near the kitchen and the layout of the restaurant felt like a cozy cafeteria. There's a few rooms inside, and so if you come in and feel like it's packed, you should be able to find a table. FYI just don't come at lunch unless you are willing to wait a LONG TIME.

To be honest, I was a bit embarrassed at first while ordering because I THOUGHT it was one of those places where you grab your food first and then pay (cafeteria) like my coworker suggested, but you actually just pay for your food and then find a seat. Luckily, the cashier was pretty welcoming and I ended up getting a Jambalaya plate for around $16 with a side of grits and red beans.

My food came out relatively quickly and I was served by a nice gentleman. And boy were the portions HUGE! If you are hungry, I really recommend Mama's because you'll be stuffed! In a nutshell, I thought that the jambalaya was definitely savory and tasty. There was a little sweet kick to it, and overall I enjoyed it. The sausages were okay, not too tender, but not too firm. Unfortunately, I wasn't a bit fan of the grits (tasted like plain porridge) and the red beans were okay. I thought the portion sizes were amazing, but I kind of wished that it was slightly cheaper. 

Overall, I had a decent experience at Mother's. The food wasn't that amazing, and I regret not ordering half and half with their famous gumbo because I felt like I was trying to force down the grits. Otherwise, portion size is a plus if you eat a lot and there's plenty of seating and there's a TV for entertainment! Just come at the right time and you'll be happy. Also, signs say don't tip, but I encourage you to tip because the server(s) are very kind. I give this place a ""tolerable, sufficient for sustenance"" rating!

the sandwich was top notch. (I can't recall what it was, because i was just mooching off of a buddy), but if came with some sort of meat sauce - and that is what stole the show.

the seafood gumbo was probably the best we had in new orleas (better than the Gumbo Shop). You can really taste the file (pronounced ""'fee-lay"") which apparently is the wood/bark stuff that is made into powder to give the gumbo a smoky taste.

I've been here twice, both on visits to NO.  The first time, at the recommendation of someone who had been there before, I got the debris  po boy and I was in heaven.  Had a bite of my friend's shrimp po boy (p.s. I hate seafood, so this was a big jump) and - TA DA! - I was delighted.  

Last time I went, got the debris po boy again - delicious, roast beef gravy heaven - and jambalaya.

I will say that this place can get SUPER crowded - lines down the street.  We happened to be there on a rainy afternoon at about 3:00, so we walked right in, got served, and sat at one of the many empty tables, so that probably adds the last star to my rating.

It's not a fancy sit-down tablecloth place...it's like a fast-food place with a deli type ambience...you get a menu from the security guard as you enter...the line was reasonable at 7 pm which surprised me...it's obvious the lines could snake outside the door and spill out onto the street. But I arrived when there was only about 8 people ahead of me...score! When I left at about 9 pm, the line had formed.

TIP: Don't scrutinize too carefully the food in the display counter as it's a sloppy mess....concentrate on what you will order...pay it...put your receipt on your table...and while you wait just a short while, look on the pics of military visitors and other conservative luminaries who have visited this place...don't judge, just enjoy when your food comes...

FRIED CATFISH PLATE: Two large pieces of catfish filet...flakey inside and crunchy outside, with some drier bits....looked dry, but wasn't totally.  It wasn't the best, but wasn't the worst...and I was surprised it was flakey inside. I slathered hot sauce on it, so even though it didn't have much flavor...the hot sauce was awesome sauce. 

You get to choose two sides:

RED BEANS & RICE: Moist, chockablockful of chicken and sausage. I liked it.

TURNIP GREENS: THE BEST YUMMIEST TURNIP GREENS EVER. My life was made perfect by these greens. If I could have stuck my nose in the small bowl, I would have. I even though about ordering more, but the long line scared me. I think my lovely waitress who brought me the food and returned the receipt to me might have been able to jump the line for me...I asked her to get me change for the tip, and she was able to do that much for me. 

PROS: Being in a NOLA institution. Lucky to find a short line. TURNIP GREENS, a must! It's got meat in it, by the way (tender chunks of pork)...*sigh* I wonder what it would be without the pork, but when in Rome. It was DELISH!!

CONS:  Lines....but really it wasn't a problem for me. Although, if the lines had been shorter, I would have jumped back in and ordered their famous po boys to try...or some dessert. Perhaps if I had not gorged and ate it ALL, I would have asked my waitress...I should have asked her how to order to go without losing my table or getting back in line. Not much for vegans or vegetarians tho.

Their ""world famous baked ham"" came out on a platter and looked just like any other ham they'd shave for you at the local deli..but here's the kicker...it came with a scaly pink appearance to it.  Reminiscent of you know when you buy raw sliced beef, and it starts to go brownish/green and you cook it and that same area turns out to be a scaly grayish/brown color?  That!  Red flag --not fresh!

That being said -don't do what I did and fall for the tourist trap slogan of ""world famous ham"".  You're better off trying some of their other offerings.  Thank goodness that's what we did.  We ordered the crawfish etoufee, dirty rice (special on saturdays), collard greens, and potato salad.  Their etoufee would probably be their saving grace, rich and yummy, good seafood flavor and hit the spot.  Even then, probably nothing that would make me go back to this place.

I should mention I never heard of it, never was pre-hyped on it.I was just walking by on the way back to my hotel and it seemed old school and cool. I was hungry after spending the afternoon in the Treme and visiting the cemeteries. Lots of walking. I hit it just right as I went in exactly before the line started to form. I walked in, stood behind one person and ordered. I got a seat no problem. Behind me , a line formed all the way outside the door down the sidewalk.It seemed to move pretty fast though to me, and the tables around me turned over fairly quickly. 

This is an old fashioned joint that has been around since the 50's. It has that look and feel. It was packed and it was not fancy or anything. The place was buzzing with business. Yep, you are going to be leaning up against someone's table while you wait, your behind will hit thier back, and your purse will probably hit thier head. You probably won't get a table right away, you will be on top of people.The walls are  covered in pictures of all the  famous people , locals and military that have eaten there. Lots to look at. You order, pay and  then you sit down and they bring it to you if you stay.When you see a big line you might consider taking it to go. Getting mad about not finding a seat when it is cram packed with a line out the door and down the street seems like a waste of energy. Cleanliness wise , Like I mentioned it is old fashioned and a bit dated, and it is just constant turnover, so I imagine there get to be straw wrappers etc., left on the tables that  they don't get to, but my table was clean and I had condiments.There were people running around with brooms and rags the whole time I was there.  I did sit a "" used "" table that was recently vacated and they came and wiped it within minutes, before the food came. For my particular order, I had fast service.  

 They won't take tips... they are just nice people. Great prices for the quality. They served  my  bloody mary out of one of those old aerator machines, way cool. I got the soft-shell crab sandwich. I must say it was one of the best things I have ever eaten, period. Perfect. The bread was so soft and fresh and the crab was cooked perfect. Seasoned perfect. The slaw was great, nice and light, crisp.  I know a line is no fun, but it was worth it. I can see how it could be a tourist trap, but it was 50/50 filled with locals and tourists.

Once you get inside its a little bit of a circus, somewhat confusing. You go through the line, pass the counter, but don't order to the register, slightly congested and unorganized but don't stress. Once you order, just find a random place to sit, someone will come by and be your food runner. Main complaint is that there is no order to that because I noticed others got the same food as us, before us, who ordered after us, if that makes any sense.The runner / bus person was so nice and friendly though.

Ok on to the food, we ate a few hours before but still wanted to try something else. Got the famous sandwich, the ferdi? Debris? Whatever it's called, it's really good. Just a bunch of meat with some great bread. Also has that moisture kind of like a beef au jus sandwich and a beef sandwich from Chicago. A full size is good to share between two people.

Also tried a bowl of the shrimp creole. Which had a hardy portion of shrimp. I don't think I've ever had. But kind of tasted like Cajun and Mexican tortilla soup combined.

I think together, the meal was around $22 or so. I think this is fair for the portion size and compared to other places in Nola.

This was possibly the BEST meal I had all weekend. This sandwich was juicy, messy, packed full of flavor, and loaded with enough meat to feed two people.  Being from a New Orleans family, I know that the messier the Po' Boy the better. And this sandwich did not disappoint.  It was so good, I ate the tiny bits that fell onto the table.  

The staff was super friendly, and I had them laughing with me before I left.  One waiter overheard me say  ""I don't even like ham, but this SH*T is so good!"".  He couldn't help but laugh and give my table a smile.

My husband read a lot of reviews of the various restaurants in the area of New Orleans that we would be close to during our stay. He was particularly excited about Mother's! We ended up eating there twice during our four day stay. The first visit was late afternoon, probably around 3:00. No line like other reviews have mentioned. In fact, there were only a few tables with patrons seated inside. I am sure the off hour was why. Husband ordered the Shrimp Po Boy, he said it was good and there was abundant shrimp on the sandwich. I had the Turkey Ferdi, which is turkey, ham and debris (parts and pieces of pot roast/beef and gravy, tastes like a french dip) topped with mustard, pickles and cabbage: excellent! I really enjoyed the sandwich. 

My only recommendation for the lunch visit would be a better reference on how the patrons are suppose to order. They tell you at the door to grab a menu and order, but it is confusing as to where you are suppose to order. Especially, when no employee is standing where you ARE suppose to order, at the register, but there are A LOT of people standing behind the food area. I saw patron after patron standing or wandering, looking confused. Trying to make eye contact with the ladies standing behind the food, who never acknowledged them or directed them to the correct place to order. This is not a good way to start a meal.  When it is busy and there is a line of people ordering, obviously this would not be a problem, follow the line. When this ordering referene is not avaibable, they need to make people feel more welcome and not assume they know where to go. 

Our dinner visit was a few days later and about 6:00ish. Again there was no line. However, the front of the restaurant was full. My husband ordered the Crawfish Etouffe and I ordered the Jambalaya. We both got the greens, I got grits and he got french fries. Husband said his dish was good, as was mine. Average, nothing over the top, which is o.k. The greens were excellent! Being from the south I love some properly seasoned and prepared greens! Mother's greens were great! 

However, the grits were some of the worse grits I have ever been served! Watery and NO seasoning whatsoever. No salt and no butter! Anyone who knows grits, knows the water must be seasoned while the grits are cooking. You can not season them afterwards, it just doesn't take for some reason. Therefore, they were not eatable. 

Mother's is very pricey! Lunch meal was over $40.00 for two of us. and the dinner was about the same. Overall, it was a good meal both times. However, I would never pay those prices at home for the same food. Relative to what our hotel was charging it was comparable. All of New Orleans seems to be ridiculously overpriced. Make sure to do your research before assuming it will be an affordable trip! Our food expenses were our biggest expense for the four days. 

Overall, I would recommend a visit to Mother's. Try and go during the off hours and you most likely will not have to wait. If you go, I highly recommend the Ferdi sandwich!",2013-08-31 12:19:25,30.0,3093,30.0,0.05357142857142857,0.05357142857142857,0.5394252788160749,0.5394252788160749

The guy at the door was super friendly as we interviewed him about the not-to-miss things on the menu.

The last time i was at Mothers, was in June of 2005, a month and a half before Katrina hit. AND LET ME TELL YOU. That was some of the best food I've ever had. My little Yankee heart raved about it. I told friends, I told family, I told strangers I met on the street. The counter ladies were quick, but not rude, but that may have been due to the fact that my dinner guest had been my 80 year old grandmother who took her sweet time despite being hustled through the line (it takes a lot to phase an elderly Italian woman). I had the fried soft shell crabs and fries with collards and bread pudding, and I'm pretty sure I gained at least three points on my cholesterol because of it, but man was it worth it! 
 
The place was a hole in the wall, and I'm pretty sure the table we sat at was missing a leg (or two).

Inside its dark and there's 3 rooms to sit at. Now to the food! After all the hype this was another disappointment in this beautiful city. It's all hype for tourists at this place. It has a great and rich history but you can have much, much better food and poboys at any other place in town. We had the debri and shrimp PoBoy and they were bland and just okay. We also had the Gumbo which was like from a can. Wait, let me refrase that, some can soups are much better. Besides the bland and tasteless food, the prices are just crazy. Dinner was over $60 with a couple of little desserts which were also ok. And the main waitress also reminded guests to leave a tip although they just brought the tray to you. 
Interesting place but never again.

i ordered the seafood combo with crawfish etoufee and tomatoes with greenbeans. it comes with red beans and rice, potatoe salad, jambalaya. my wife ordered their signature po boy.

the seafood combo was okay. if i had a choice....i would only order the crawfisg etoufee.

Mother's Restaurant, even though they were always busy because of how popular they are, not just amongst tourists, but amongst the New Orleans locals, you still got your food in a decent amount of time. I think the 2 or 3 nights I got dinner from there, I waited probably like 15-20 min for my food. It might seem like a long time, but it wasn't all that bad.

To put this in context, this isn't perhaps a totally fair review as we had everything done in their private dining room, so I'm not quite sure what the regular experience is like - but what I do know is that one of the servers told my GF to stop being such a ""pain in the ass"" when she asked for more fried shrimp and the bartender straight up told me that he was having a shitty night....soooooo...yes....the place may be named Mother's, but it certainly didn't make me feel surrounded by unconditional love, support, and fleece vests, which is what mama N specializes in. Confusing. 

Overall, the night was lovely as we got to start celebrating K&J - but the food was distinctly subpar and as much as I appreciate being made to feel like a burden on those around me, the service left something to be desired.

Sampled the fried oysters, fried shrimp, red beans/rice, and was w friends who hit the fried chicken, jambalaya, turkey sandos, and ham - overall, the oysters were a bit soggy and metallic for my taste - the shrimp equally unappetizing - and the salad was #basic at its finest - underripe tomatoes, soggy greens, and shattered dreams - but I think ppl found the fried chicken decent. The ham, surprisingly, went largely uncommented upon, leaving me to assume that it was not the celebration of the pig that anyone imagined.

The best thing were these random chocolate chip cookies that I began housing once I realized that the actual entrees were not going to bring it home - but the bread pudding w bourbon sauce I sampled was only moderately respectable, though certainly pales in comparison to the Ritz's chocolate croissant bread pudding of my dreams.

If you're a paying customer, po'boys are $6.5-14 (turkey, sausage, shrimp, oyster, catfish, calamari), plates are $13-16 (etouffee, shrimp creole, fried chicken, ham dinner, jambalaya, etc), and other mains are around the same. Overall, the shrimp weighs leaden in my tum and my heart saddened by the mediocrity of the attitude towards patrons, but I guess...it's an institution?

If we got tired or thirsty we would pop in a bar, sit have a drink and continue our journey.

Hubby had the cup of gumbo and a ham sandwich the first time. The ham was magical. MAGICAL I SAY. The second time had fried chicken and the 3rd time had red beans and rice.

My friend had breakfast two eggs, grits, ham and biscuits the 1st time. 2nd time the ham sandwich and the 3rd time the gumbo.

I had the Famous Ferdi Special ham, roast beef, debris and gravy. They debris and gravy are all the yummy bits that fall off the meat and land in the au ju and then poored over your sandwich. I had this everytime we went. I fell in love with it. I could seriously drink the gravy it is heavenly.

There is always a line, so get to know your neighbor you will be waiting awhile. They pass menus down so you know what you want when you get in. It does move really fast but do not hem and haw. Know you order and say it as soon as they ask.

So a group of about 8 of us went there for breakfast while we were in town for a conference.

Instead of being seated at a table, you are directed to pick up a menu and head to the counter to place your order. This forces you to make a quick decision since you only ahve a few minutes to place your order. This is good if you are quick to pick your meal but not so great if you're slow.

Since you don't get to pick your table until after you've gotten your order, it can be a bit tricky for a larger group. We went to the back room and found the last table that would hold 8. However, no one was in a hurry to clean up the mess from the previous patrons. 

Actually no one was in a hurry to do anything. I should have gotten the clue when I noticed the large ""We do not accept tips"" sign over the bar.

I rarely give bad reviews but THIS PLACE IS GROSS. It's down right nasty freaking gross. It looks run down, the service sucks; it's horribly slow. The waitress kept forgetting some of our orders. One of my colleagues didn't even get her meal until after everyone else was done. The grits we ordered never came. This didn't even appear to be an isolated incident.

Good anytime, late night Po'Boy especially.

The line is daunting but its quick and efficient trip up to the front register where you order.  And you better know what you want.  Those cashiers have got no time for your lolligagging.  

A+    Crawfish Etouffee Omelete  -  The crawfish was obviously awesome but the thing is that the eggs were awesome too.  Its a light, perfectly cooked simple egg omelete.  The etoufee is generously portioned and off to the side.  

The Bread Pudding and muffins have canned fruit in them.  Yeah, the kind you get at the supermarket.  The one with the wierd pink cherry and lots of white and off white fruit chunks.  Makes it moist but I wasn't crazy for it.

Plusses: Clean tables, quick and polite service, clear menu with many different options.

Minuses: Price, Crowd, and quality of the Ferdi.

Overall it's a two and a half star restaurant which I've rounded up because it's located in the greatest city on earth.

I don't get all the hoopla about the damn Ferdi poboy.  It's ham and roast beef on a less-than-stellar bread.  IMO a good quality poboy should be able to be held in your hands and eaten without slopping out of them and falling into your plate in a puddle of soggy, unattractive mess.  There is too much watered down gravy swirling around in that sandwich and at the bottom of your plate for the sub-par bread to handle.  It decomposes way too quickly.  

One positive aspect unique to Mother's is the coleslaw they serve on the poboys.  It did blend nicely with the meats and I do prefer it to the normal dressings on poboys you find elsewhere (lettuce, tomato, and mayo).

But if you want a better debris poboy go to Parkway or Parasol's.  You'll get more strongly flavored, thicker debris and a larger sandwich.",2010-03-09 05:43:40,15.0,1280,15.0,0.06493506493506493,0.06493506493506493,0.41926274578121053,0.41926274578121053

I'm an avid yelp reader but this is my very first review-  honestly this place and the experience was SO HORRIBLE I have to warn others to stay the hell away from this hideous tourist trap that INEXPLICABLY has been reeling in out-of-town suckers...

On my visit to New Orleans, which was overwhelmingly pleasant, awesome, and tasty- this was the ultimate low point [both food and otherwise].  After a night of hard partying and finally scraping ourselves together to venture out for sustenance and more adventures, I recalled a recommendation to hit Mother's for ""the best"" shrimp po' boy.  A short walk away, and we were there, excited, and ready to feast!  

As soon as we walked in and were completely ignored, them glared/glanced at by the person who was supposed to be seating us/showing us where to order, we should have walked straight out.  Instead we stood awkwardly before finally being acknowledged and told to ""grab menus and get in line"".  At first glance, the menu was overpriced, but we figured it would be worth it [$27 for a shrimp po'boy, a tiny bowl of salad and two lemonades?!].  The troughs behind the counter holding the slop looked DISGUSTING, dirty, old, and crusted over, but I chose to ignore that and approached the counter.  

I work and have worked in the food service industry for a long time, and I understand that people can be annoying sometimes when ordering and it can be hard to hide your annoyance when having a bad day. Sometimes you're just not feeling it, and I GET THAT!   I therefore try to be incredibly succinct and pleasant when I am eating out and ordering.  It didn't matter one tiny bit to the girl taking orders, hands down THE rudest girl I have EVER interacted with in the restaurant business.  Her attitude was decidedly nasty, sarcastic and all around made us feel uncomfortable.  She didn't even bother to pour us our drinks [lemonade] when we ordered, or let us know how our food would be delivered.  She just glared at us and acted like we were responsible for killing her mom or something, just because we were making her DO HER JOB which is RING US UP.   Sorry about that, bitch.  

After sitting down and feeling confused about why we were treated so badly at the counter, and wondering where our drinks were, and how we would get our food, they called our number and we went to check and were told to sit down because they would bring it to us.   Here comes the kicker!!!  The po'boy was on dry, stale bread with a paltry amount of bland, rubbery, lukewarm fried shrimp and a haphazard assortment of cabbage drenched in mayo.  The salad literally tasted like dirt, and was gritty, like they hadn]t bothered to wash the vegetables.  After taking one bite of my half of the po'boy, I felt like crying, because I had dragged my girlfriends to this awful place with awful service and awful food.  

THEN came ""the hair that saved us"".  When biting into her half of the sando, my sister found a long, thick, black hair inside the sandwich.  None of us have long black hair.  It was not our hair!  We were seriously relieved about it, because it meant we could get our money back and get the hell out of that place!!!  Which, of course, was another ordeal in and of itself.

We're locals but never ate there before so decided to have New Year's Day lunch.  Got there t 10:45 and the line was shorter than usual, meaning not yet all the way down the block. 

When we were motioned inside, we were told (and I mean TOLD) to line up against the far wall and wait our turn to order.  There's a break in the line so staff can pass through into the kitchen. A server barked at us not to block the way, and that set the tone for the rest of the meal. 

It's sort of like a fast food place in that you order from a cashier and then you are served your meal when it is ready. The cashiers were simply uninterested in being pleasant. Brusque and really just plain rude.  Just imagine you are eating lunch at the Department of Motor Vehicles and the staff are a bunch of disinterested or PO'd civil servants. Well, welcome to Mother's. ;-)

Seriously, the only person who was pleasant was our waiter. 

As for the food, it was okay down home but not memorable. Cabbage, black-eyed peas and corned beef and a slice French bread.  The corned beef was waaaay too chewy and needlessly so. Cabbage and peas were a bit bland, not what I expect from a New Orleans restaurant.  Ham was okay but not the city's best much less the world's. 

I would say that if you're a tourist there are too many good places in town to waste your time here. And for locals, you probably already know but just in case you didn't.",2013-01-01 22:06:18,12.0,1446,12.0,0.04316546762589928,0.04316546762589928,0.3155710098229302,0.3155710098229302

I just had a sandwich at a franchise yesterday for half as much money and was twice the flavor. I ordered the Ferdi, I would have stuck to the Cajun food but this place is suppose to be famous for the great ham and the Ferdi is the house speciality, how can you go wrong with that.  The Ferdi is like a combination of a  cold-cut and a bland Italian beef.  All it really did was provide a void left in my stomach from not having ate all day. It was a very boring choice, in a city filled with food culture this is a bad choice, it made me wish I was in Chicago where I could get some real food.  Maybe if it were served with some Italian gardenia  mixed in with the soggy shredded beef it could be salvaged into a good eat, but it wasn't so you'll never know.

Save your money - for a better experience just grab some fast food, Or go to the French quarter.

You then find a place to sit (with your drinks-Coffee there was AMAZING).  Then the fun begins.  We chose a seat by the gap.  Watching all the other first timers walk in was fun.  Since we had been there 5 minutes by this point we were TOTAL MOTHERS EXPERTS.  Watching someone block the gap was incredibly funny!  FIRST TIMERS-HA!  See, the thing about places like this is the structure, the code, the military precision with which they perform a chaotic task.  OK enough about the show...the food.  Simply put...it was amazing.  We had eggs and biscuits and the coffee.  We also ordered 3 orders of BREAD PUDDING to bring back with us.

Destination Mother's. 

Recommended by our hotel, Mother's is both a tourist trap and a regulars' place. 

They were a bit pricey, put well worth it! 

Mother's claims to serve The Best Baked Ham in the World! Who doesn't want to go to a joint that serves The Best Baked Ham in the World? In one year Mother's cooks 175,000 pounds of ham & roast beef, 30,000 pounds of sausage, and 90,000 pounds of jambalaya. Mmm, mmm good! They also have such gems as Turtle Soup, Crawfish √âtouff√©e, Red Beans & Rice, and any kind of Po' Boy you could ever want to grace your taste buds on their menu! 

Freedle ordered herself up the Combination Platter of Jambalaya, √âtouff√©e, red beans & rice, and potato salad. Leah got herself a giant Po' Boy, and I couldn't help from orderin' the fried chicken! 

The food totally won us over - it was a great New Orleans ""food cherry popping"" experience.

This place was recommended from a friend of ours and by some Yelp friends as well. So if you read a few of the reviews already, Mother's gets a lot of attention and a lot of traffic.  There's usually a line outside, but for us, it went by really quick.  

Couple of other things to point out...
-They don't seem too patient for you to make up your mind so be prepared, be very prepared on what you want to order. 
-While in line, you'll be given a menu to that you're prepared to order
-Seating is first come, first serve
-This is a fast paced restaurant.  Don't worry, you're allowed to linger and they don't kick you out.  But because your order is taken so quick and the employees are constantly cleaning tables, you may feel rushed.  
-Known for their ham, but it's their Po Boy sandwiches that dominates the menu.
-Tips:  There's signs everywhere stating that they do not accept tips.  But we were educated by one of the employees that told us that those signs were posted back in 1939.  In other words, tips aren't expected but welcomed
-They serve an average of 2,000 orders per day.  Some orders can be a low as a single guest or as high as group of people.  Do the math, that's a lot of Po' Boys being served.  

My Dishes:  
Jerry's Jambalaya ($6.50 for a cup):  Of course, I got their Jambalaya. Not the best that I've had, but good enough for me to finish.  I got mine with sausage and chicken.  It wasn't too spicy, but still had a kick to it. Yes, I deMELished it. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=v4JG_fM6tCBTJYppdEDUMQ&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ

Famous Ferdi Special ($11.75 Reg): They're known for this Po' Boy, so of course I got this. This Po' Boy included their famous ham, roast beef, debris, gravy, pickles, and mustard.  I was impressed with the meats in my Po' Boy due to the flavor and the amount that they hooked up.  However, I wasn't too impressed with the bread and thought that the mustard & pickles overwhelmed the meats. I had to try this and it was still good. I recommend if you're visiting Mother's for the first time. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=P0cU9XSGXdIzeKqYQ2diOA&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ

Our group of 6 had a mix of what Mother's had to offer.  The gf had their Debris, which she didn't finish since it was huge.  But she liked it.  Others in our group got their Shrimp Creole, Shrimp Po' Boy, and Seafood Gumbo. I didn't try their orders, but was told that by them that they were completely satisfied, especially with the Shrimp Creole.  

Price:
-Breakfast ($3-$12.50):  I think most were on the high side
-Po' Boys ($9.50-$17.50)  Priced just about right depending on what you get and what size. 
-Plates ($11-$19):  Great deals here
-Seafood ($16-$25.50):  Average

Mother's has a enough on their menu to keep everyone happy. Overall, I have to say that I'm a fan.  

Got Ham?:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=PlFqlsmfXZ2UUmFK6ftgJg&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ

The Ralph Ferdi is the greatest sandwich ever made. It's a po'boy with roast beef, baked ham, debris and cheese. Debris are pieces of beef that have been soaked in gravy.

The good:
The food was good. People in my group had several different items which we shared bites of so I sampled a lot of dishes. The shrimp po boy, seafood gumbo, Ferdi Special, and a few others. Everything was good but not great. You can find better in New Orleans but for the price it was about what I expected.

The bad:
The service was atrocious. Our group was trickled in over about an hour as we came from different places. When we arrived, we asked the door manager if they could let our group in as they arrived. He let 2 in who arrived after us but another manager then kicked us out of our seats saying he needed the table for other groups and refused to let anyone in passed the line. What makes me mad is that they didn't even fill those seats before our group showed up. The seats stayed empty for 20 minutes so when more showed up, we went back to where we were sitting before.

As a self proclaimed foodie, I did some extensive research on finding the best gumbo in the downtown/French Quarters area of New Orleans and several people reviewed this place as having the best in the city. 

I landed at MSY at 4 pm and made my way to Mothers by 6:30 pm with the specific purpose of dining and feasting upon red beans and rice and the seafood gumbo (inner fat girl took over me). I was surprised to see how ""laid back"" the inside was but I liked that. We were welcomed by a nice gentlemen at the door who told us how to order. We found ourselves a seat and waited for the food to come out. 

The gumbo arrived and I took my first spoonful into my mouth anddddddd.....it was just okay. I'm from Chicago and it's really hard to find gumbo that's noteworthy but I can honestly say I've had better. Don't get me wrong it was good, but it wasn't fully hot and I counted a total of 4 miniature shrimp in my bowl. Now the red beans and rice on the other hand made me think of my own mother's recipe and they get 5 stars! I topped this meal off with the bread pudding, and my mouth thanked me...it was delicious...inside I noticed there were grapes, pineapples and other fruit baked inside the bread.

A few days later I was in search of a delicious shrimp po boy and was told by my hotel concierge to give Mothers another try, so I did and it was AMAZING. The shrimp were super fresh, fried to perfection and rested upon a stack of pickles and coleslaw. I wanted to go back for another but in fear of being judged I decided not to, lol.

The sign out front says its known for baked ham but they have alot of good stuff in addition to that. Don't be scared by the line out front. The line was about 6 deep outside the door and the server said something about 40 minute wait to get our food which scared some people away. We walked in about 5 minutes and once inside we lined up and was able to place our order in about 5 to 10 minutes.

This place is known in addition to their ham (which to me was tasted like, er ham) for their Debris which is a type of roast beef which resembles moist, shredded beef brisket. The Debris sandwich has this and the au jus like a French Dip. It's pretty damn good. I actually got the Ferdie which is turkey/ham/debris. I also got a cup of gumbo for $6. Sandwiches are large, I can eat a whole but can easily be shared with 2 people if you have a small appetite. So my one knock on this place is the price. $11.75 for the ferdie special (sandwich only, no side) and $6 for gumbo and ~$2 for an iced tea. My friend ordered the sandwich, and etouffee and a side of grits. Our bill came out to $50 (!).

Real sweet staff. I went on a Tuesday at 10am. No line like the weekends. Bread pudding is fresh at 1030am, but I hadn't had breakfast, so I decided to sit with a bowl of grits and wait.

Piping hot and perfect flavor and texture. I like to bury two pads of butter right into the core of the piping hot bowl and let them melt down before I mix together the salty butter into the perfectly cooked grits. I treat myself to one (or two or three) heavily buttered bites before I complete mixing the two ingredients into a more proportionate ratio. YUM. Creamy, hearty, filling. Plan to share!

My Mom joined me shortly after I'd started my grits and got in line for the bread pudding. The woman at the register was real nice, actually called to me to ask if I was ready for my order, not realizing the next woman was my mom! She didn't forget about me. So damn sweet and attentive.

Years ago, I saw a famous person here, Woody Allen if my memory serves me correctly, though it's very foggy.

Weekends (Sunday's) are especially busy, but weekdays seem to be at a perfect pace.

Lady: No chicken
Me: I'm sorry you don't have chicken or you don't want me to have chicken because there is some chicken over there.
Lady: No chicken
Me: ok Turkey Po'Boy 3/4 order (you can order a smaller sandwich), some chips, a small drink, plus the gf's turkey sandwich.
Lady: $31.01
Me: Say what? You want how much for a sandwich?!?!?! I think you should pay me for almost waiting an hour in line!! (I said this all with a smile on my face but I don't think she thought it was funny)
Lady: Do you want your order?

It's one of the places to try in New Orleans, and it's one that I never did in the years that I lived here, and only recently tried out on a trip. 

It's a great breakfast, and the debris is really good. I, however, found it a little pricey - although still reasonable - for what it was (considering I can get eggs, grits, and a biscuit for half of what I paid here.)

I had their shrimp creole with a side of collard greens and red beans and rice. I also asked for a cup of jambalaya. The sides were all very tasty, but I am not a fan of the shrimp creole. The shrimps were overcooked and it was just really not very good. 

However, given the fact that my choices for the sides just seem to be a really bad combination, I would have been more forgiving had the staff been nicer.

We were told we HAD to try the breakfast here and were unquestionably disappointed. We came on a Wednesday morning and waited 30 minutes in line JUST to order. The line stretched down the hall and to the front door. I was trying to find a a table for my family of five and I. The only table available in the front room was a four-seated table, I glanced in the back and it seemed to be completely full. So, like a normal person would, I grabbed one of the extra chairs stacked in the corner and added it to the four-sided table. As soon as I sat down to hold our table while the rest ordered, one of the ""managers"" immediately grabbed the chair from the table and yelled ""YOU CAN'T DO THAT! This table is for FOUR PEOPLE ONLY, NOT FIVE! I have plenty of tables in the back that you can use"" and walked away. I was taken back. I could not believe how stupid I was made to feel. We decided to wait in line anyway. Every two seconds, a server would break the line by pushing (and I mean PUSHING) their way through while screaming ""Out of my way!"" or ""Hot plate!"" (one which missed my face by a centimeter). We put in our orders and proceeded to find a table while juggling our drinks in hand. Went to the back room and the ""plenty of tables"" that were promised were all unavailable.We found a back-back room with tables but the door was slightly closed and a few employees were sitting at a messy table all on their phones. We asked a server if we could use one of these tables and she spat "" HOW MANY YOU HAVE?"". We replied five and she aimlessly looked around the room, rolled her eyes, and threw napkins and forks on an empty table right next to the ""break room"" table. We sat down and in comes a few employees screaming ""HEY HOE"" ""WHATS UP B*TCHES"" to the workers on their break. There was another family right next to us with children as well. Lovely. 
We waited another 30 minutes after we sat down for our food to come. I ordered the breakfast special. Their ""famous ham"" was could, and cut VERY thickly. Th eggs were mediocre and required lots of salt and pepper.

i know guides and people will tell you to try the debris and a few other items like fried oyster po boy, but everything i have ever had there has been delicious. 

try the biscuits. if you order eggs, you get one, but you might want to order a few more if you are in a big party. 

i like there shrimp po boys. my fiance is a fan of the grits.

this time and once before after they took my receipt they have lost my order, which isn't a big deal. just make sure you check in w/ the lady who took it after a while if you have not gotten your food.

The line wasn't bad at all (it was closer to 2 pm), so we lucked out. 

We walked in and we were given menus and ushered to the counter to place our orders. We got to the cashier and she was texting while taking our order. I asked her to explain what two things on the menu were. Her answers were abrupt and weren't very helpful. At this point, her attention was still on her cellphone. We paid for our food and sat down. We weren't told what our numbers were so we just sat at our table and waited for a little while until a server came asking for our receipt. Then we found out the number they were calling was ours. If the cashier had told us what our number was and to listen for it, it would have saved us a little bit of confusion.

During weekends, there is usually a relatively long line to get into the restaurant, but the line [usually] goes quickly. The first dish I tried here was their seafood gumbo, and it turned out to be my favorite dish in the whole restaurant. Their gumbo is AWESOME! I also have tried their fried chicken (which was served with a biscuit, mashed potatoes, and french fries), as well as their jambalaya---and they were both also delicious.

The only reason I do not give this place a 5/5 is because I wish the portions were larger than they actually are. Even when ordering a ""large"" size of a dish, I do not feel it's enough to call it a meal on its own.I do not eat a lot and it does not take a lot to get me full, but at this restaurant, I feel less-than-satisfied with the amount of food served in a single dish since I do not feel ""stuffed"". As a result, I usually end up either sharing another dish with a friend/family member, ordering a side dish, or getting a big dessert (either at the restaurant, or at another place in NOLA).

The ambience of this restaurant can be described as ""busy, crowded, and relatively loud"". During my few visits at Mother's, people were constantly walking around looking for a table in a not-so-spacious restaurant (since it is self-seating). Plenty of workers were also walking around cleaning tables and/or giving utensils to customers.

Lastly, I was always told that their baked ham is amazing (and is deemed the ""world's best""), but I have yet to try it. I was also told by locals that this place is quite ""touristy"", so if one wants to try authentic ""Louisiana home-cooking"", one should eat elsewhere.",2016-05-19 03:06:43,21.0,1706,21.0,0.06930693069306931,0.06930693069306931,0.5084283763063671,0.5084283763063671

Me and my friend were just struggling to find a breakfast/brunch place in New Orleans because it was too early in the morning and both of us were desperately in need of coffee. And that was our only plan - to just get coffee and been awakened enough to decide the next thing to do in NOLA. We had arrived earlier than 6:30am at NOLA airport to drop off 2 friends there, and we were sleepy as hell.
Mother's Restaurant seemed like its was closed but luckily the owner/manager just happened to be at the door and spoke to us and asked us to come in if we wanted to. So we went inn thinking that we were just getting coffee and that's what we did.
But the expression on the guy's face was as if he had got cheated and we definitely should have ordered breakfast food.
We stood patiently in the long queue and ordered our coffees and then waited patiently to get our coffees 'to go' because we suddenly did not feel welcome anymore just because we did not order food.
And guess what, we had to remind the lady at the beverage counter to make our coffees as she had totally forgotten to make our coffees.
I am still giving 4 stars to this restaurant out of gratitude for serving us coffee.
And yeah, by the way I totally missed out on describing the ambience of this place. I would rather not, because there is not much to describe.

In retrospect, I could've done with less eggs but altogether, no regrets. The ham was fantastic, and I'm not much of a ham fan. Usually I find it too dry and salty, altogether uneventful. But this wasn't the case with Mother's baked ham. The biscuit was warm and fluffy, and the grits went so well with the crawfish sauce in the omelet. 

The service was fine. Not rude or noticeably friendly. Works for me.",2010-12-29 15:24:14,2.0,1338,2.0,0.00819672131147541,0.00819672131147541,0.05467665518138081,0.05467665518138081

Our rather large party of 11 entered the restaurant and was told by a security officer to proceed to order ""quickly"" in the line  If you want someone to order quickly, don't give the such a long list of items to choose from( We did pull it together pretty fast needless,to say).
We then seated at two tables next to each other. The waitress was extremely RUDE! She barked at us to put our receipt on the tables, she needed to write on them. Informed us all that we needed to hurry up they needed to close and they had to get out of there. Each meal came out one at a time and not in any kind of order. (All dried out and cold) My order of a simple fried chicken poboy was somehow not on my receipt with my other items. 
They waitress told me,"" I better get up and pay for that at the front!""  She then went off on the counter person for making the mistake that now set her time frame off. It took awhile and my party was really almost through eating at that point.
I THEN RECEIVED MY SANDWICH IN A DOGGIE BAG..THEY WERE NOT WASHING ANYMORE DISHES !!! I was about 4 bites into my food when the security person came over to one of our tables...is was a group of children were ages 11-18 and told them to GET OUT THEY WERE DONE EATING.

Let me paint a picture for you. It was a breezy New Orleans evening and I was standing in line between a family of eight and two French tourists. The line outside of Mother's was inexplicably long, which is good for Mother's bad for someone who's just hungry and needs a grab and go meal. 

There was a security guard at the helm of the restaurant, passing menus down the ever growing line behind me. He let us in two, three, and one at a time. When I stepped into Mother's, it was packed. This is obviously a big tourist trap in the city and I can see why. Between all the autographed pictures of celebrities and New Orleans Saints paraphernalia, the walls were bursting with kitsch . 

You order in a long line that spans the length of the restaurant while about twenty workers with gold teeth pack the food in front of you. When it was finally my time to order, I couldn't get my credit card out fast enough for the cashier who was already taking the French tourists order behind me. I ordered the Jerry's Jambalaya which came out fast enough. After all, all they had to do was scoop it out of the serving trays and slap it into some to go containers. Seeing as how there was no where to sit and I didn't want to hang around in the sardine container of a restaurant any longer, I took my meal to go. 

The food was not bad and for the price of a $15 platter, I got a lot of it. I had the Jambalaya, the greens, and grits. The grits tasted like cardboard and I ended up tossing them, but everything else was alright. 

As for my over all review, the place was alright. Go if you're willing to wait in line for a quick much talked about meal, otherwise, yeah, it ain't all that.",2014-03-25 15:41:46,6.0,1842,6.0,0.016853932584269662,0.016853932584269662,0.13979976373859893,0.13979976373859893

I honestly don't see how any local New Orleanian or even New Orleans transplant could give a positive review of this place.  It is the very definition of a tourist trap, with the ridiculous prices to match.

THE GOOD

Er...

THE BAD

Combination Platter (jambalaya, etouffee, red beans, greens, potato salad): All edible but nothing special, and you can literally go to ANY place in New Orleans to get this stuff.  What truly makes it bad is that for one 10-inch plate of the simplest food possible, they charge $18.25.  Seriously.  I guess it was my fault for ordering it in the first place because I should have known better, but at the time I visited Mother's I was basically a tourist myself.  I still wish that my buddy who came with me and had been three years into his New Orleans experience had at least given me a warning...

Meat Side Order of ""World's Best Baked Ham"": Not even close.  Nowhere near the ballpark of being the best anything.  I've had better ham from the deli counter at Rouses.  Flavorless, dried-out ham is never good, especially when it's for an unconscionable $5.25 for a small plate.

PURGATORY

Service: Half of the employees didn't care and were rude, especially the people taking orders who had absolutely no patience for customers who were unfamiliar with the ordering process (myself included).  Fortunately, there were a couple good eggs in this rotten bunch and their cheerfulness saved an otherwise dismal experience.  I guess getting decent service is a total crapshoot here.

OVERALL

Overpriced, under-flavored tourist trap.  Save yourself the trouble and don't come here.  Maybe their po-boys are good, but I'm certainly never coming back to find out.  It gets two stars instead of one because that's what I would have given it if I had reviewed the place the moment after I ate it, with a tourist mentality, before really getting a chance to experience the finer aspects of New Orleans cuisine.

They offer take out or seat in. The place is not fancy, it's like eating at a diner/cafeteria seating. We all got different things shrimp in the PoBoy was light and tender, yummy. My soft shell crab fried was alright but the greens were the best part. The side of greens came hot, juicy and full of potato bits, onion, and pork chunks. No need to season just perfect.

If it says anything about the deliciousness of the food, during those 7 days I managed to eat here 3 times. Once for breakfast, once for lunch and once for dinner.

Breakfast was probably the most filling of the three meals. I had a Mae's Omelet, which was filled with large chunks of the delicious homemade ham, the grits that came with it were far from creamy grits, but they were still quite delicious. The biscuit that came with it was fairly standard, but the homemade jam that joined the biscuit was amazing.

The lunch I had here was a Ferdi special. I won't bore you with all the details because I'm sure it has been talked about before, but to let anyone know the Au Jus that comes with the sandwich can make it a bit messy, so definitely anticipate that if you were planning on eating here for part of a business meeting.

The dinner I had was a fried oyster po'boy. This was delicious. The house tartar sauce is quite great. It has a small bit of spice to it and with some extra Tabasco thrown on everything goes perfectly together.

Other reviewers are right, the place is a bit overpriced.

My husband and I are in town for the 49ers game and walked past as we were on our way to check in across the street at the Staybridge. In planning our first trip to New Orleans, I yelped A LOT and got recommendations from friends on where to go and what to do. I then created an itinerary of suggestions venues, for breakfast, lunch, dinner etc. 
Let's just say, I'm baffled as to why this place wasn't mentioned by friends or why I hadn't come across it before on Yelp.  I only decided to look up the menu because after my nap, I was hungry and dinner was still a few hours away. The reviews were positive and thanks helpers for the photos because, they helped me decide.  I ordered the shrimp po' boy and sweet potato pie for hubby and I got the combination platter and the brownie. Now, I will say I got the combo platter because I wanted to try a few things... It came with crawfish √©touff√©e, red beans, jambalaya, potato salad and one veggie - I got the greens. I totally expected to taste the potato salad and give it to hubby since I don't usually like potato salad. But I only let him taste it and I ate the whole thing! Then the greens... I only got them because my side had to be a vegetable but I don't like greens. Well, if all greens tasted like these, maybe I would. Total yum and I ate the whole thing. That's why I had to write a review. 
Finally, the staff was very friendly! Wonderful customer service even though I'm a 49ers fan, one of the guys actually helped me carry my bag of food and my drinks across the street to the hotel.

This restaurant is very busy. The wait wasn't as long as I expected it to be. You have to go up to the register and place your order then find a table. The servers will then come and take your receipt and bring out your order. We waited quite a bit for our food. The server explained that anytime you order chicken it is a longer wait b/c it's made to order. The food was good. But the Po Boy bread was to hard I couldn't eat it. I did not like how the staff were going in the kitchen getting food while we were sitting waiting on our food. (Our seat was near the kitchen) there was also another server sitting at a table next to us; I assume she was on her break. I think restaurants should have a break room.

We walked across the french quarter and the two or so streets up from where we had been just for this lunch.

There was a line, but not one out the door like we had seen so we thought we'd really lucked out!  We got in line with our menus delivered to us at the door.  Most of that time we were in the way of someone- be it customer struggling to find a seat or one of the staff demanding that we clear a path.  (Rudely so I might add, there wasn't really anywhere to move TO and we were trying very hard to keep out of the way.)

When we got up to the counter, we ordered red beans and rice, a Ferdi po boy, and a catfish po boy.  I'm not sure what our fourth had - something ham or chicken on a sandwich.  

Seating was a nightmare.  We wandered several minutes attempting to find a spot and once we found an empty (but dirty) table, we quickly sat down to try and save it for our family.  The waitress came over and took our ticket to the window (seemed like an odd practice in its own?) but forgot the second ticket so our order was staggered.  It took several minutes for someone to come and clean the table and honestly the staff didn't seem all that concerned about it.  I realize that the restaurant was busy, and we knew when we sat down that it was a dirty table but several workers passed us and it almost seemed like they were pretending not to notice the state of several of the much needed tables.  

The ferdi and red beans and rice came first.  It was almost fifteen minutes later that the third and fourth plates came to our table.  The ferdi seemed to have been sitting not in gravy but in a juice that came from the meat - not a problem if you're ready to eat but it arrived at the table with the typically tougher french bread already soaked through and breaking apart.  I barely got a bite in before the whole thing disintegrated and became impossible to eat without relying heavily on napkins and forks.  The red beans and rice was what my boyfriend called 'okay'.  I think he just didn't want to admit that he'd paid so much for an over salty plate that really lacked flavor.

When the other plates finally did come, my mother who had ordered the catfish poboy took her first bite and immediately spit her food out. This woman LOVES catfish and I've never seen her send back a dish.  She pushed her plate aside after a second and third attempt dissecting the plate trying to find which part was so offensive.  She said the fish was mushy and muddy.  

Tables around us were filled with families, one was a couple with three small children.  The parents and one of the children received their meals but the other two sat there for almost twenty minutes without their plates after their family was initially served - when the plates arrived?  Pancakes.  They'd waited an additional twenty minutes for two short stacks. Even then, the mother had an order of a biscuit that took additional time to be delivered, she seemed done with her meal by that point.

After watching my mother miss a meal because of the food quality, we urged her to complain to the manager.  To his credit, he did offer to replace her dish but she was so turned off at that point that she just wanted a refund which he DID provide without argument.  He brought her cash (15 dollars for an inedible plate) and some bread pudding to try and make up for it.  While he was delivering the plate, however, he tipped it forward and poured the sauce all over the table and down my mother's pant leg.  He didn't seem to realize.  She had to decline the desert and tell him that she was a diabetic but he left the plate anyway saying that one of us would eat it.  We tried a few bites while my mother and sister went to the bathroom and attempted to clean the sticky mess up.  She spent the rest of the day covered in the dark goo.

We aren't typically very fussy people, we were eager to try a legendary place in New Orleans but we were HEAVILY disappointed.  This place seems to survive on reputation alone and ignore a lot of basic service needs and food quality.  Tourists, don't listen to the hype.",2015-01-04 02:08:03,-10.0,4212,10.0,-0.012224938875305624,0.012224938875305624,-0.15408338784034142,0.15408338784034142

It was only about a 5 minute walk from our hotel, there was a line but not too long. Dining area appears to look limited but there are additional seating towards the back of the restaurant. Ordering process was a little unique. Be sure to pick up a menu and find your place in line. 

Beware...the servers are very strict on cutting the line and blocking walk ways leading towards the kitchen. Please be sure to make way for servers. Please be respectful towards the staff they don't play around. But staff is very friendly. And don't make the mistake of cutting in line especially if you are in a big group. On our second visit at this restaurant, the police officer manning the front door and the owner of the restaurant kicked out a huge party of foreigners. They definitely have the right to not serve you if you are disrespectful.

It is a good idea to know exactly what you want before reaching the cashier. Coming from California, service is different but not too much of a culture shock. They are straight forward and take orders quickly. I would avoid making too many customizations on orders if you can tolerate it, but that's just me being from California.

The food was awesome! I've never had a sandwich like the ""Ferdi Special"". We were a party of 3 and pretty much ordered all we could sample on the menu because well when you're in New Orleans you are not on a diet right? I would recommend the Ferdi Special, if you are a light eater you can definitely split this sandwich with a companion. Please note, the cashier will not ask what size sandwich you want specifically. I think they automatically default to a large. So make sure to let them know. We also ordered a pecan pie and sweet potatoe pie which was delicious. I also ordered a waffle because we had to fit breakfast somewhere in there. 

Once you have ordered, take your receipt, find a place to sit and give your receipt to a server. She/He will then proceed to take your drink requests  and will bring your meal hopefully in less than 30 minutes. Keep in mind, service is a bit slower and laid back.

I had a ""regular"" size gumbo which was very small, but a little bigger than a cup. It was $8.50 and had to be loaded with crystals hot sauce. Sadly, it was not amazing and had little flavor. We were going to share the combo but hubs was hungry and devoured it all. 
I got up and re ordered more food. I got the fried catfish plate with 2 sides... wait for it...for $17. It was $17 of sadness.

The remarkable thing is that they managed to grill the fish in tons of butter and with the skin on.

Finally 1 lady in the back room where I was seated came over and took charge of the problem.  She sent back the sandwich and gave me a straight up hot debris sandwich. 

I have no problem if i was too early and it wasnt ready but dont serve one ice cold.  The lady even touched the sandwich and said oh this just came out of the fridge (meaning the ham ).  

Yelpers, sorry if I am not intravenously hooked up to Yelp and 3 days have gone by without me answering a food merchant.

Upon arriving there was a decent line outside, but it moved quickly. Do not let that line intimidate you! 

I ordered the Seafood Gumbo and a side of green beans and my significant other ordered the gumbo and turnip greens. There is plenty of seating here and some that are a more community feel. Everything was phenomenal. It outlived my already high expectations. The seasonings used in everything was perfection. I have never had anything like it before. The green beans have tomatoes with it and were tasty.

When I eventually figured out on my own that this was a go-up-to-the-counter-and-place-your-own-order kind o' deal, the dude there told me to ""grab one o' dem menus over dare and order what you want over dare..."" and that was it for the service... So, I ordered the specialty of the house - ""the world's best baked ham,"" turnip greens, red beans and rice (one of my favorite Cajun dishes) and grits. All of the side dishes were nothing special - very ordinary BUT the ham in particular was ridiculously disappointing... Instead of a nice thick slab of real meat that was piping hot or at least warm, I received six very thinly sliced cold cuts(!) that were - cold! Where the hell was I? In a Subway Sandwich shop??!!

""the world's best baked ham,"" eh? In a pig's eye (literally speaking)!

   If I could rate this restaurant purely on the fried chicken alone, it would be five stars. Crispy, juicy, simple home town goodness. The service was top-notch but a little hectic with workers all around yukking it up behind me. The atmosphere here is soul food home town but it felt like it was geared to give out of town tourists an ""authentic soul food experience"". Maybe the tourist just happened to take over a classic local favorite. Either way, Mothers does not try to hard to impress with extra fluff. They are really good and what they're good at and the rest they don't seem to care much about pleasing anyone. At one point I thought maybe they couldn't really give the place of the room cleaning up because it's always so crowded all the time. (I guess I'm politely saying that it was a little bit dirty) I truly don't want to be rude because the man who was serving us water was really great.  All in all, either way,  I'm glad I tried it.

When we went for lunch, there was an insane line out the door and we had to wait forever. Once inside, there was another huge line. You basically take a menu, figure out what you want, and by the time you get to the register, you better know what you want.

This place is incredibly crowded and cramped, and it seemed very overstaffed to me. Way too many employees walking around, standing around talking, being rude if you were in their way.

For breakfast I had an egg white, turkey omelet. It had no flavor at all. And the turkey tasted old. It was served with biscuits, butter and jam. Those were good. I barely ate the omelet though.

The line wasn't long yet since we went before 8am. When we arrived the restaurant had just opened which was good because the line can get long here. Despite the food being displayed on a cafeteria like line, you place your order at the register and then the food is delivered to the table. 

We just needed something simple and basic because we weren't trying to get too full before brunch. We shared the breakfast special which came with eggs, grits, sausage and a biscuit. It worked out perfect since my friend wanted just grits, eggs and sausage and I wanted the biscuit with sausage.   The sausage and eggs were standard; I don't think you can do too much to mess that up. The biscuit was good too. But those grits, NO SIR!  Immediately upon tasting them I knew they were instant. They also were prepared without any salt or butter because they were completely devoid of flavor.  To confirm my assumption, the cans of Quaker instant grits were lined up on a shelf in the kitchen and visible from the dining room.
 
This breakfast served its purpose for us and we were not starving before brunch but it is definitely a breakfast that would make me want to return.

*Their Shrimp √âtouff√©e was delicious!  I'd definitely order again. 
*Best skin-on fried chicken I've had in a very long time and quite possibly the best I've ever had - sorry mom. Crunchy on the outside and tender moist on the inside. Consider an order or two for sharing if you have a large group. 
*Their ham they say is famous just didn't reach the delicious hype they advertise.  It was good, however, and a gracious portion. 
*Their red beans and rice side needed some salt, but it was delicious and authentic New Orleans. Additionally, it was plentiful with ham and sausage.  
*Yummy warm biscuits are made in house.  You can watch them at their biscuit making craft as they have a sidewalk window that lets you see them in action.

It is more of a sit down, fast food type restaurant, but not exactly.  When you walk into the restaurant, there is usually a line (first time we walked by, the line was out the door and down half a block) that moves rather quickly (about 20 mins).  As you stand in line, you need to decide what you want, because once you arrive at the Cashier, you need to be ready to give your order.  The cashier does not waste any time taking your order, and moving you along for the next person.  Interestingly, all the workers, behind the counters, in the kitchen and serving, were older ladies which, to me, is great to see.  Once your food is ready, it is brought to your table (based on the number you were given), and then you eat.  Their breakfast consist of the usual selections, and they also have many of the typical Southern foods for lunch.  I ordered the Famous Ferdi Special, which is a plate of Ham, Roast Beef, the ""debris,"" and Au Jus gravy.  I was not aware of what ""debris"" was until it showed up on my plate, and I found out that it is just all the meat bits, fat, charred pieces, etc. that falls off the roast while it is cooking.

There are a few iterations of this specialty, and as of this writing, I'm not sure which one was sampled, though I'm inclined to think it might have been the Ferdi. The straw that stirs this particular drink is what the menu describes as ""debris"", the meat which falls into the pan when cooking roast beef. Janice and I headed over for an absolutely lazy (for us) breakfast at 9ish.  She ordered the Debris Po'boy, while I stuck with a traditional breakfast waffle, though it came loaded with sweet, thick peaches and syrup. In addition, I ordered hot sausages. Janice definitely got the winner here. The debris is luscious, juicy, original and still satisfyingly familiar, and her only regret is that she didn't get the larger sandwich. I only got a bite, so I regretfully seconded her emotion. Not that my waffle was anything to sneeze at. It would have been excellent in any establishment, and I didn't send anything back except a few tablespoons of syrup. And 3/4 of a hot sausage, because they served two, and while scrumptious,  they were huge. It should be noted that service is unique, and  a little strange here. Food is ordered directly from the counter, but served in the back by servers who've been doing it for a minute. The coffee was hot and luxurious, refills came in plenty of time. It should be noted that in several locations throughout the restaurant, signs clearly proclaim that there is ""no tipping"" and that the waitstaff would refuse one if offered. However, when I began to ask our server, before I was four words into the sentence, she said ""it's up to you"".  Pressed, she said that the signage was meant to be a joke, although I will freely admit to not being entertained. The food and the service warranted a gratuity, and any suggestion that people should walk out without leaving one seems to be ill advised and badly intended. Guess what?  I'm going to leave even more next time, and next time can't happen soon enough.",2019-05-06 22:36:40,3.0,2914,3.0,0.005780346820809248,0.005780346820809248,0.05557461733534295,0.05557461733534295

It DEF was not what I expected - no waiter service, just pick up menus by the front door- order...and know what you want when you get there or you will get an attitude! 
Place your order, have a seat and wait to be amazed!
I thought the ""attitude"" at the counter added to the charm of the place...but my friend was a little turned off by it...
I had the Roast Beef Po'Boy sandwich, covered in DEBRIS.  The DEBRIS is the roast beef that falls into the gravy as it is cooking. Dont miss this! AMAZING!   The sandwich was so delicious I wish I was back in New Orleans to get another one...

We had lunch at Mother's on a Tuesday, arriving around 11:50.  There was a line of 10 or so when we arrived, and by the time we left it was out the door.  The line moved a little slower than I was expecting, although I do not think that was the staff's fault.  It appeared to be due to people taking a long time to decide what they want.  So, the moral of the story is when you are in popular/busy/crowded places, make your mind up quickly.

My main course was a catfish po' boy, but we all shared so I also tried:  the famous ferdi, fried shrimp, red beans and rice, fries, potato salad, and the ham.  The po' boys are pretty basic, large white rolls with iceberg lettuce, what appeared to be standard store bought dill pickles, and basic mayo.  The catfish was good, it was fried well and it was a good amount.  I did need some salt and pepper, but with seasoning it was good.  The same can be said of the shrimp, it was fried well but needed salt.  The bread to filling ratio was off on the po' boys, I thought there was too much bread.  Had the shrimp and catfish been stronger I would have given 4 stars.

The sandwiches with ham (the Ferdi and the ham sandwich) were superior in my estimation.  I understand that Mother's is known for its ham, and for good reason.  It was flavorful and tender.  It was the star of the meal.  The ham po boy had was excellent, due in part to the ham and the spicy mustard.

The Ferdi is good, and as you have seen on TV, it is very messy.  Knife and fork job unless you are willing to get really dirty whilst eating.  The debris is tender and juicy, the bread sort of holds up to the jus, but not really.  As the meal went on the whole thing kind of dissolved.  This sandwich is iconic for a reason and is worth a try.

The sides were surprisingly good.  I was expecting more standard fries but they were thin, long (maybe the longest fry I have ever eaten, should have taken a pic...) and crunchy.  Very strong.  The potato salad was classic deli potato salad, but it was homemade and prepared well.  The red beans and rice were lacking in seasoning, so a dose of hot sauce was needed.  They were not the best I had on my trip, but I would eat them again.",2019-03-26 20:15:21,48.0,2390,48.0,0.09896907216494845,0.09896907216494845,0.9818435396750714,0.9818435396750714

Fried Chicken - This was so good and it came with a nice fluffy biscuit. The chicken is super moist and tender and it's coated in a light, crispy and nicely seasoned batter.

Jambalaya - I'm usually just okay with jambalaya, but I found this to be really good! It had a nice tomato-y flavor and a hint of spice. The rice was cooked well and had a pillow-y pilaf texture and I found myself eating this the most.

Gumbo - Another gumbo, but this one wasn't as thick as the Gumbo Shop. I still really liked it though as it had a nice seafood and smokey flavor.

Overall, good place for some NOLA vibes and home cooking.

Don't be rude and ask them questions or point to something Asking what's that?  How does it taste?  Just be casually cool and make your observations and move on.  
Anyway, after ordering  you will receive your receipt which you will be place on the table where you are seated.  Now, you can either sit in the main area if a seat is available or head further into the restaurant where there are more seating options.  This is up to you...., find a seat and sit there.

Catfish sucked--had that texture I hated that's dry and stringyliney and not moist at all. It's like they picked the worst seafood possible at a discount: tiny dry oysters and shrimps that were not plump. It was almost as if they took shrimp, fried it and refried the next day where lots of mostly just bits of batter remained in the platter. Or they fried it and then reheated it. Only the white dipping sauce could save it. I couldn't even remove the breading. Worst ever. Cold too. Deanie's Seafood slays and is delicious wo the sauce if you want some sort of standard. Only thing I liked at Mother's was the string bean red pepper side dish despite its watery base: it had a nice and surprising tang to save it. The turnip leaves were basic and cooked long enough--quite bland despite minimal salt seasoning or whatever else could've been in it. Pecan pie: you only get nuts on the topside, not inside. It's overly sweet. Like the entire inside is the ""binder"" of pecan pie, no nuts on the inside. At least the top and crust had some crunchy texture. I like Redfish's pecan pie which I wish Mother's could be more like. This just was a sugar overload even for a sweet tooth like me. Not sure if they used tons of corn syrup. Salad was horrible. Only the little 3 grape tomatoes was the freshest part of it. It's not worth all I paid for barely a handful of leaves. Barely! Those who rave about this Mother's place is doing it just for ambience and its long tradition. Right now not a place to recommend.

The restaurant was packed for a Friday morning. We had to wait outside the door for a few minutes before the line inside moved enough for us to come in.

Ordering is cafeteria style. You pass the containers of food and line of workers assembling orders through sneeze guards before hitting the register, ordering your food, and paying. If you ordered a drink, you wait right next to the register for those drinks to be given to you. We decided on the Ferdi Special & a bowl of jambalaya for myself. All this costs a little over $20, which is a great deal. If you visit when it is busy (which it will almost most likely be), may the odds be in your favor when looking for a table. They are almost always taken immediately after a group leaves.

Workers walk around with orders looking at your receipt to match the right table. I would think there would be a more efficient way of handling this to save errors from happening. We were given an extra piece of bread pudding we never ordered. Not complaining though! It was delicious.

Food was given in great portions, just like in the rest of New Orleans. However, I was very underwhelmed at the quality. The debris po'boy was very plain from the few bites I had tried and I thought my jambalaya was a little too salty. However, with the amount of food we were served, I didn't mind. My boyfriend, who usually could eat a horse and still have room for dessert, could barely stomach half the sandwich. This was a very big plus. However, we decided not to take the leftovers with us for a later meal because of the sheer amount of sodium we had lingering in our dry mouths.

If you are a neat freak like me, I suggest you try your hardest not to look down by the containers of food and on the floor. I had a very hard time not grimacing at the amount of grime, grease, and dirt in the restaurant. Then again, it's the food that matters, right?

Honestly, I would not come again. The restaurant was in dire need of a deep cleaning, food was underwhelming, and service was lacking (not including a couple amazing waitresses that served us).

One thing you MUST know about Mothers is there is a flow to the place that might have you ordering and seated immediately or with a decent sized wait. This is NOT a sit and order style restaurant, but rather a, ""know what you want"" counter order experience, then they bring your order to your table when prepared. 

I'd love to have a long and eloquent review of Mother's, but is mostly home style food with some featured dishes (black ham). My son and I got Catfish and Fried Chicken with grits and fries which were great for what it was but nothing really stood out as more than home cooking from Mother.

I don't if I learned about Mother's on television or from back in the day when I was a college kid on a one-day visit to see Marni Gras years ago... either way, as an adult I wanted to experience Mother's for myself... 

Especially since seeing their 3.5 star rating... not a bad score but not overly impressive either... After all, the food pictures online looked good... but then again, the place looked kinda dumpy. 

Our plane landed... our shuttle brings us to our hotel... we check out bags with our white-gloved door man... and it turns out Mother's is just a couple blocks from our hotel... why not, we're hungry and it's on the ""To-Do"" list

Opening the door to the red-brick building... long line... sign of good things I hope. It's cafeteria style (order from staff in a line as you move along the various dishes until you reach the register to hand over your cash... a lot of it too.

Based on the costs, I am under the impression they cater to tourist and not so much the locals... I am on vacation so why not... 

They're were so many dishes to pick from so I chose the COMBINATION PLATTER... at 20 dollars (yikes)... it comes with Jambalaya, Crawfish √âtouff√©e, Red Beans & Rice, Turnip Greens and Potato Salad. No complaints at all... just pure deliciousness

Marisol tossed all rules of healthy eating beyond mine and went straight for their FRIED CHICKEN DINNER... which also came with a choice of two sides; Cabbage and Red Beans & Rice

As we ate, different staff asked if we needed anything or they could take some of our trash... all were loaded with personality and perky... loving the vibe. 

They told us about the BREAD PUDDING... lots of hype so we grab a serving to go along with PECAN PIE. The Pecan Pie was 11 out of 10 on a pie chart... but the Bread Pudding was a total let down; seemed oily rather than sweet. 

And that Pecan Pie was so good that we would go out drinking... and end up talking about that Pecan Pie once we were tipsy... life sure does change as you get older...

I'm still not a fan of Cajun food, but recently Mother's has climbed the ladder in my book. On a recent trip to New Orleans for work, my co-workers suggested we eat at Mother's. Preferring to eat elsewhere but not wanting to be anti-social, I went with everyone but decided not to eat, thinking I'd go eat elsewhere afterwards. 

I sat with everyone as they had their meals. The server asked me for my ticket so she could get my food. I told her I wasn't eating. ""You not eating?!?"" she asked in amazement. Long story short, after everyone else had their food, she brought me some bread, butter, red beans and rice, and a tea. I was completely surprised and touched.

I loved this hidden gem

We were visit NOLA and we got lost walking there
 but let me tell you, my bf and I went to Mother's 3 times in the 3 days we stayed in NOLA. 
Flavorful and homemade comfort food. 

Honestly, if I could fly back to New Orleans, this is 100% the first place I am go


Update- came back to NOLA and first place we went to was Mother's. 

The line was long, but we got our food fast. 
Ironic since there are signs behind the serving area and register that state employees aren't allowed to be on their phones, but all of them were on their phones. I stood in front of the register for about 2 minutes before the one girl finally stopped texting before taking my order. 

Ended up going back around 9pm for dinner--there was no line, but the wait for my food took 25 minutes. The people forgot my order and noticed that i was sitting in the waiting area for 15 minutes and then came over and asked what I was waiting for. 
When I finally for my order to go, opened it and got the most disappointing Ferdi po' boy ever. It was supposed to have ham, roast beef and the debris with au jus, and all we received was DRY piece of bread with ham and roast beef with some mustard. 
I'm giving this 2.5 stars now just because it was late night and the service was really bad both times. 

Gonna try to go one more time before heading back to philly, but hopefully it's better the third tome around.",2019-06-02 13:39:10,4.0,1436,4.0,0.014545454545454545,0.014545454545454545,0.1055559627938519,0.1055559627938519

bread pudding- one of the best. It was moist, creamy and not too sweet.

greens- there were HUGE chunks of ham in it which made it very salty.

Mother's is (rightfully) an institution.  The debris is epic especially after a few too many.  You know who you are, my fellow fans of excessive libation!  Nothing exceeds like excess.

Everyday there is a long line way out the door, me and my family are originally from Los Angeles/New York and decided to try it out. Not only is there a long line outside but another once you reach the inside.

The staff was quite rude, bad customer service and no social skills. The prices are outrageous and most dishes come with no sides and you have to order them seperate.
A shrimp PO boy with no sides and an omelette with grits and 2 sodas came to $32.17.

You pay first and then find a seat amongst all the un-bussed, dirty tables, with flys all over the place, take your ticket receipt out and wait.

It was interesting that we waited 30 minutes and none of these people took any interest in the whereabouts of our food? They never came by - how long were to wait before someone would have said - oh, you have been here for 2 hours and have never been served. Who knows.

If you order water, they have a spout where you can fill/refill as you choose. I had a fried shrimp and oyster po' boy. It was massive! The fried seafood was spilling out of the sandwich with each bite. I found the bread to be very dense and the dressing (I.e. Lettuce, tomato, Mayo, pickle) to all work out nicely. Unfortunately, it was too heavy for me so I just ate the innards. I tried my friend's fried catfish salad. The catfish seemed to be bigger than the salad! Loved the breading. I also got to sample the grits. Now THAT will cure a hangover. Same with the the crawfish etouffee, which was my intended target and then hangover brain took over.

The selection is pretty extensive and includes everything from breakfast essentials to turtle soup and everything in between.

The Ralph (fendi w/ cheese) was effectively a fancied up french dip with some slaw on the bottom. A side of sausage was good, but a little on the small side for $6, but the Jumbalaya was fantastic - well worth the price of admission...or the price of the dish.

Overall, the place was good, not great, but worth checking out. The food is expensive for what you're getting, but it's seriously an experience.

You sit where you like, a nice guy or gal grabs your receipt and brings you your food a few minutes later. Quite nice and they're all very friendly!

I am generally not a fan of them but when there was a sign posted saying world famous, I figured I had to try it.  This was the first time that I actually enjoyed it and thought about getting another one.

The line to get in can be really long. In order to not crowd the inside of the restaurant they will have people stand in a queue outside and then allow about 10 or so people to go in.  When you get in you still have to stand in line.  The way the line is it does feel like a greasy old diner and almost reminded me of a soup kitchen line but not free of course.  While you are in line you will pass the area where they have some of the food but you order when you get to the cashier.  They are one of the few places that will take credit cards thank god!  
Once you place your order, you take your receipt and drink with you and find a table.  This isn't clear when you first get your receipt.  You can sit anywhere that's open and then the staff will come by and take your receipt and bring back to the table.  One of the waitstaff was a bit rude and seemed annoyed by me asking her anything that I was scared to ask her anything like how do I get my coffee. Eventually she became nicer but  I'm guessing she probably realized I was not drunk and wasn't being rude to her.  
I ordered the waffles with blueberry compote.  It was good but I wouldn't say anything extraordinary.  By far I think I was just impressed with how good the bloody mary was!  Too bad there was no where to just order a bloody mary from without having to stand in the line!

Not quite understanding the meaning behind this I left for New Orleans with the notion that at some point I would have to go to some restaurant and ask for debris. As much as I wanted to follow my relative's advice, every time we passed Mother's there was always a line around the block (it was Mardi Gras after all) and my stomach was not willing to listen to the rationale that a two hour wait would be worth it. On Lundi Gras however, we had visited the WWII museum and while walking back to our hotel noticed that there was NO LINE outside Mother's. We decided that it was a good time to investigate and immediately ran over. 

First of all, the interior isn't anything all that special as many reviewers have commented on. It really is just a diner, but the service is friendly and the food was delicious so it is definitely worth vising. 

Each of us ordered the Ferdi Special with debris, and then we split a cup of gumbo and an order of bread pudding. First of all, the gumbo was pretty good and in itself was satisfactory, let alone the HUGE sandwich that is the Ferdi special. It is a gastronomic work of art in my opinion. The sandwich is baked ham and roast beef with gravy, mayo, pickles, and mustard, (I think there was cole slaw as well), and the combination of textures and flavors is surprisingly delightful. The crispness of the cole slaw and pickles works to balance the sogginess of the gravy soaked bread and soft meats. We both agreed that if we could only have a sandwich as our last meal we would want it to be the Ferdi Special.

During our four day stay we ended up going to Mother's three times! The first day stopped in late and had the seafood platter; fried shrimp, fried oysters, and fried catfish. I had grits, red beans and rice, and turnip greens for sides. All the food was fantastic. The batter is light and crisp, everything is seasoned well but lightly to accommodate tastes.
The next day I went for breakfast. I had a ham and mushroom omelet with grits and a biscuit.  The portions are hugs and the food was even better than dinner. Breakfast is definitely the best meal unless you are drunk and need to soak up some alcohol late at night. 
Finally today before heading to the airport I finally stopped for fried chicken. I had the 1/4 white meat with fries and red beans and rice. The chicken was delicious, juicy and seasoned perfectly. Everything was really good.
The staff are awesome at Mother's...especially considering they are not allowed to accept tips. To order you have to go through a little test...get your menu, walk to the counter, order, take your seat, put your ticket out and if you pass you get served!

Our waitress went on her break and sat at the table next to ours and didn't even let us know or ask us if we needed anything before she did. So the entire time we needed more coffee or anything we felt too uncomfortable to ask since we didn't want to bother her on her lunch. 

As she was on lunch, the other waitresses would come up to her and talk badly about the other tables. 

Maybe if they replace the grumpy rude staff with some nicer people this place would be decent.

Last I was here was July 2014 and I had longer waits then which was surprising. It made me a bit weary but eventually the crowds came. I made my way here twice during the recent visit and left with regrets of not being able to eat more.

Food:
Being the plain jane that I am my first round on this trip I ordered the Shrimp Po Boy. I was only able to eat half and saved the second half for my late night snack.

My second trip I ordered the Jambalaya and loved every bit of it. Much better than anything I've had in Nashville but thats not really saying much.

The only thing I can honestly say was how disappointed I was with the fries. I didn't like them on my last trip nor did I enjoy them on this one. They weren't horrible they were just... boring ole french fries. But my entree made up for everything.

I had the Jerry's Jambalaya, which was flavorful and packed with chunks of Andouille sausage and chicken. I chose sides of potato salad (skip it) and turnip greens (which had enough roast pork in it to be considered an entree). 

Portion was massive, and everything tasted good and fresh, if a little mild. But that's ok - every table is equipped with large bottles of Tabasco and Louisiana Hot Sauce.

I happened to see a picture my friend took and posted on her facebook of a line at this restaurant.  I asked about it and she said she stood in it and was worth the wait so I had to give it a shot.
My husband and I got there about 11:45AM.  We waited in line outside until it started to rain and the restaurant was nice enough to have people move the line inside and wait.  We thought wheew, can't be that bad but as soon as we got in, the line was still longer than we thought and went along side the entire dining area.  That's OK, gave me a chance to look at other peoples food.  Lord but it confused me even more because it ALL looked so good.  I was so excited and knew everything I was about to eat, no matter what it was I picked was going to be good. Once you get to the beginning of the line you dont get seated, you tell the lady what your ordering keep moving in line and order you drink than find a open seat, which as busy as it was that wasn't a problem.   I decided to go with lunch instead of breakfast food and got the crawfish ettouffee, red beans and rice, grits and a biscuit.  The Ettoufee was fabulous, I wish it were bottomless.  I wanted more.  The red beans and rice, what can I say but YUMMMMMMM  I love a good red beand & rice.  I hate it when I go somewhere that says they have it than order it and it's not the real red beans & rice, but this....this oh yes it is!!!  I can appreciate it that.  The grits werent special, seemed the same to me.  I would rather double up on the beans, lol.  And the biscuits were just fantastic fabulous!!!  Homemade and mouth watering!  My husband couldnt keep his paws off mine!  So my review, I was very please with it all and would absolutely go back there and and recommend someone to visit before leaving New Orleans.  It must be a staple restaurant of Nawlins.  Now, my hubby ordered a Po Boy, I am not so crazy about sandwiches filled with me, I did take a bite and w/o the mayo it would have been better for me but it was good.

I definitely wasn't expecting the format and ended up feeling rushed because there was a VERY long line of customers behind us waiting to order.  The woman who took our order at the register was pretty disconnected, blank stare and no smiles as my family franticly tried to decide on what to order.  Then disconnection turned to an expression that screamed ""will you hurry the hell up and order"".
 
So we rushed through annoyed, left wondering if we made the best choices, and shocked by the bill. This place is really expensive in my opinion, for what we actually got in terms of service, food quality and ambiance.  Anyway, we got a table in the back by the kitchen (never a good thing) because it was so packed, then food came out, quickly, but that is to be expected as all they had to do is scoop it out of the warming pans at the counter.
   
So, a couple of the kids got the Famous Ferdi Special and they both loved it.  I sampled the gumbo, crawfish etouffee, red beans and rice with ham chunks and they were all A-OK, none of those dishes made me hum and close my eyes in enjoyment, so I was disappointed. I guess my expectations were high based on the reviews and recommendations.  I was most disappointed by the fried oysters, which unlike another reviewer's experience, mine were very small and mushy, and I couldn't really tell that they were fried.
  
On the bright side, the best thing I had was the bread pudding which honestly, based on the presentation; I was not rushing to try it.  It sat in the bowl looking like a mushy unrecognizable mess (so sorry to say that but it did) but OH it was YumOLicious!

I have a theory. 

I think there is something Bourdieuian happening with Yelp, and Mothers is a perfect example. 

You go to NOLA, you have a great time, you ask where you should eat and everyone says ""Mothers! It's an institution!"" so you go ... and you eat the food, and then you write a Yelp review that reinforces the fact that you, a tourist, ate the food at that institution. In so doing you both burnish your own cred as someone who ""gets"" NOLA, and you burnish Mother's cred as a Genuine New Orleans Institution. 

My point isn't that Mothers isn't good.

Super cool, casual, historic, with great Eats!
Mother's claim to fame is the best baked ham in New Orleans, although I went there cause all the locals said to try it out.   Everything is made in house (desserts, sausages, roasts, ham, etc) and with a full bar in the back room and giant tvs, its a great place to catch a game. Considering they've been there 80 years, you know they are doing something right.
Their are multiple dining rooms in this cavernous old historic building.
Tons of famous people align the walls. 
service is cafeteria style. There are always lines here that move quickly. You'll get a menu while on line, order your food, get your drink and then find a table. Once seated a server will stop by to grab your receipt and bring you your food. Everything runs smooth, efficiently, and with a smile.
I had their fried oyster \shrimp po' boy served with shredded cabbage, sliced pickles, and mayo (you can ask for tartar or cocktail if you want).
This has to be one of my favorite sandwiches now. Had a small side of red beans and rice (mmm.Good!) and for dessert, a slab of their bread pudding with whiskey sauce (Amazing!)
I also tried a piece of their special :  The Ferdi po' boy consisting of their famous baked ham, house made roast beef with debris au jus gravy.
DEBRIS is the scrapings of all that good burnt meat at the bottom of the pan that some chefs ""deglaze"" with. It was very good, but didn't beat my po boy.
Their seafood gumbo with shrimp, crab, and oysters, in a delicate crab stock with okra and their house roux just slaps you in the face and says, "" You're in New Orleans now, so pay attention!"" One of the best gumbos I've ever had.
By the end of the meal I was in such a happy, comfort zone mood, I had to pass the kitchen and commend the cooks on duty.

Although the food was okay, if we ever find our way back to NOLA, I'd come back to give them a second chance and try something different.

After watching Adam Richman from Man vs. Food pay a visit and eat a juicy Po-Boy - I just had to try it! YES - there is ALWAYS a line and its always LONG. But suck it up - because it goes pretty fast. I'd say we had at least 30 people in front of us and we were in within 15 min. Why? The restaurant inside is HUGE (self-seating) and the line to order your food inside is basically the only bottle neck.

--Famous Fredi's Special ($11.75)--
MUST TRY! This is what Mother's is known for! This sandwich is basically a huge pile of meat all placed between a french roll (which is also dipped in meat juice)! SO hearty and satisfying! What kinds of meat you ask? A variety: black ham, thick slices of roast beef, and of course the DEBRIS! When they described it on Man vs. Food - I was a little disturbed. The bits and pieces of left over meat - how can that be good? IT IS! TRUST! Its like a juicier version of pulled pork - soft and slow cooked! Make sure you get a stack of napkins - because this sandwich can get MESSY. With the meat juice, shredded cabbage, globs of mayo + mustard, gravy, and of course the layers of meat, you will have to wipe with each bite. All the meat went really well with the tangy and yet creamy sauces - I went to carnivore heaven!

--Jerry's Omelete ($11)--
After feeling a little sickly from all the heavy meals in NOLA - I ordered an egg white omelete in hopes of giving my poor stomach a break. The omelete was filled with bell pepper, turkey, red onions, and mushrooms. This was the blandest plate of food ever! I had to salt + pepper with each bite! Not only that, the topping to egg proportion was too little and the entire plate was covered in grease! I did enjoy the taste of grits - which I'm not used to! Felt like home in my belly! :) I also got to try Mother's famous jam with my toast.. but all in all, this is a dish to avoid.

--Combination Platter ($19)--
Yes we're tourists and we want to taste everything. So what better way than to order the combo platter which comes with Jerry's Jambalaya, etouffee, red beans, vegetables, and potato salad!? This plate is a blessing because you do get to try so many dishes - but after tasting these same dishes elsewhere in NOLA, I can tell you this combination platter may not be worth it. A lot of the food @ Mother's just tasted really mushy, goopy, and a little bland. The etouffee was one shining star on the dish - which was very flavorful. I think one downfall of this dish is that all these dishes are plopped onto the same tiny plate and the flavors get lost in the mix!

--Mae's Gumbo Cup ($6)--
A small little cup of gumbo - which tasted homey and less salty than other places. But I honestly had a hard time differentiating the different gumbos at the variety of NOLA restaurants. Meh - nothing special.

All I can base the review on is what it is now. It's a sandwich shop with a really long line most of the time. We stopped by on a Sunday at 5:30, there was very little traffic, and we got the Ferdi which is the signature sandwich, apparently. 

They are slow. I'm going to say that up front. If you're in a hurry, I'm sure this will annoy you. If you're on vacation, then there's probably no rush. They take their time either way.

We got 1 sandwich and split it. We got it to go and took it over to the little Roman fountain and sat in the sun and ate it. They put the stewed meat on the side so it wouldn't make a mess of the bread & the bag, which was nice. We slapped it all together and almost made a total mess of ourselves but managed not to dump and of the juice on us. 

It was very good. It wasn't great, it wasn't awful. It wasn't overrated or underrated. It was good. I'm glad I didn't wait 30 minutes in line for this, so I would say to go on off hours and enjoy it then. In reading other people's reviews I wish I had gotten the bread pudding but at this stage I may explode if I keep eating 4-5 meals a day down here. The sandwich itself was tasty, the pickle-based slaw was a good contrast to the meat. The juice of the meat made the sandwich. Without that, it would be ordinary at best. The meat was good, but not seasoned particularly well or anything. 

I have to think that if there's a long line, it may not be worth the wait. They also do a turtle soup apparently but it was out the day we went.

Mother's Restaurant was our choice for lunch since it was close to our hotel (always a plus) and it had received good word of mouth from the locals we had encountered and reviews from our fellow Yelpers.  As we approached the restaurant, we saw a large group of locals finishing off their cigarettes before entering.  Thankfully, we got inside before them which meant placing our order and finding a table was a snap!  

Mother's isn't much to look at in terms of d√©cor, think a local diner, but I do have to admit all of the photos on the wall of some of their memorable customers (more military members than celebs) did give it a quaint feel.  Service at Mother's is somewhat impersonal.  You place your order at a counter like a fast food joint and your food is brought out to your table a few minutes later.  Still, first and foremost, I came here for the food.      

Although Mother's claims to have the ""World's Best Baked Ham"", I wanted a Po'Boy although, truth be told, Po'Boys aren't my favorite sandwich in the world.  However, when in Rome, you have to go with the local flavor.  I had the ""small"" Shrimp Po'Boy ($12.75) and a cup of Mae's File Gumbo ($5.75).  While the Po'Boy claimed to be a small Po'Boy, for roughly a dollar more, I could've had the large.  That must be one big sandwich!   The shrimp were hot out of the fryer with the right amount of breading, fried to perfection.  The smallish cup of gumbo was chock full of roasted chicken and andouille sausage in a flavorful roux.

The best thing about Mother's is that it is a great example of southern/creole/cajun food and culture (considering the wait staff and their propensity to call you ""baby"".  That was friendly and endearing).

My wife and I stayed directly across the street at the W and observed a long line out the door at Mother's all the time, even at 10:30 on a rainy Wednesday morning (things may have been unusually busy because the Sugar Bowl was in town that week).  It is not really worth waiting 20 minutes or more (outdoors) for this restaurant.  If you can go to Mother's when there is no line (or very short line), very early in the morning maybe, I may be more inclined to rate this 3.0/5.0.

The waiting and the crowded, chaotic atmosphere is not pleasant and does not lend itself to a relaxing experience.  The food is decent but nothing too special.  The gumbo was very solid (what place in or around the Quarter doesn't have pretty darn good gumbo?) as was the jambalaya and red beans and rice.  Further, for what you get, and after waiting in such a long line, the prices were borderline absurd.  A small bowl of gumbo is $7.95 and most any poboy or sandwich is pushing $12 to $15.

On the list with a chain of asterisks highlighting it was Mother's Restaurant. Our friend noted that when going to Mother's, we should not be in a rush. There will be lines, he warned, very long lines, but don't be dissuaded, this place will be worth your while. Right before leaving for New Orleans, we mentioned the restaurant to another colleague, who when hearing the name exclaimed ""You just HAVE to bring me some black ham biscuits!!"" as he threw us a twenty dollar bill and grinned from ear to ear. 

We saved Mother's for breakfast on our last day. When pulling up, we noticed not the building, but the lines of people.  We grabbed a newspaper and sunglasses and eased into what we thought would be one hell of a wait. Thankfully we were handed menus to salivate over while we stood underneath the blistering sun. Much to our surprise however, the line moved rather quickly. Lofting aromas of what would soon be our very own breakfast kept us intrigued. Once we finally got inside, I was momentarily confused about the setup of the place. It looked like counter-service but there were food runners and waiters scurrying around.  We ordered from the counter and found a table. Our server was a boisterous woman who asked for our drink orders and then said ""You know what, I think you two need some of my special juice"". We smiled and said OK. The waitress served us a juice mixture of I'm guessing every juice they had in house and it was surprisingly delicious. Maybe even more so simply due to the hilarious nature of the situation. 

The menu was stocked with mouth-watering treats. We went with the biscuits because we felt it was only right after our fanatic friends' recommendations. Sadly enough they were out of the Black Ham biscuits, something that I now know is an extremely wanted item and in turn runs out quickly. So we went with the baked ham biscuits which resulted in happy bellies all around. The meat was obviously slow cooked and simmered, the biscuits crumbled in our mouths. We even took the 20 dollars of biscuits all 12 hours back to North Carolina to our awaiting friend. Overall Mother's was a delightful experience both food-wise and as far as entertainment.

I had added a copious amount of Crystal hot sauce. And for those who know me, I'm a wimp when it comes to spicy.

I mean you still need people for lines so the place is popular but not worth the wait.

The ordering system is weird, unlike most places where you come in sit at a table and then order from a waitress, at Mother's you stand in line and order as soon as you enter, this is the reason the line is usually out of the door because the ordering area is small, you have to push people out of the door while they wait to order at the register.  After you order and pay, they give you a receipt, you find a seat somewhere in this warehouse sized place and someone will take your receipt and bring the food to you.

Staff is friendly, a smile and pleasantries for all. Ordering process is easy with the cashier controlling the line and moving it quickly.

Food is just okay, because of a mix up with the waitstaff, I believe I was given the wrong plate, as it as similar to what I ordered I thought it was mine until 5 minutes later they bring me another plate of the exact same thing.

Once you sit down a waiter comes to you and you give them your receipt to get your food.  The waiters are very pushy, but, hey, it is part of the experience as well.

Mother's doesn't serve po-boys before 11, which I knew and perhaps a po-boy at 7am is inappropriate to begin with.  I ordered the breakfast special, which came with choice of eggs (which I ordered over easy), meat (which I ordered debris), grits, and a biscuit.

Let's start with the edible - biscuit.  Nice size, crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, but really nothing special.  That's about it for edible.

""eggs"" - As I said above, the eggs were ordered over easy.  By the time I opened my take out tray, there was a huge pool of water that enveloped the eggs.  No discernible runny yolk, or even a yolk at all.  One bite and done.

Debris - a brown mystery meat concoction that was flavorless.  I am an adventurous eater and am a huge fan of all things meaty, but I would not serve this to my dog.  

Grits - loose, oily and flavorless.  The portion was humongous and really unnecessary.

I expected both the roast beef and the debris to be hot. The roast beef was thick, cold, and tough and the debris was lukewarm. And the bread was dry to the point of being crumbly.

My co-worker said that the Ferdie was meh. The third said that the only thing he'd reorder was the greens. And the fourth said his was ok, but he wouldn't come back if given the choice. 

I don't know why this place has such a good reputation. The sandwiches were somewhere between inedible and mediocre and the only thing worth reordering was the greens. 

If you want a really good sandwich in New Orleans, skip Mother's and go to Stein's Deli on the 2200 block of Magazine St.",2018-11-19 17:59:39,10.0,1227,10.0,0.04524886877828054,0.04524886877828054,0.2854813347699592,0.2854813347699592

I don't eat pork so it was hard to find something on the menu i was willing to try. I went to the pancakes and eggs. You would think pretty simple right. Absolutely not the eggs must have been powder. The pancakes weren't good at all.

I had the oyster and shrimp poboy, it was quite delicious. The shrimp were especially tasty and large!! I also had a cup of Mae's Fil√© Gumbo. There were some great spices and flavors inside. It wasn't all that spicy to me, but then again I'm pretty accustomed to spicy food. Definitely yummy though. 

Dad had the shrimp poboy, said the bread wasn't the best for a poboy. Although he thoroughly enjoyed the shrimp so anything with shrimp here is apparently a good bet! 

Mom had the debris poboy, one of their more famous items on the menu. Said the roast beef was packed with flavor. I tried a bite myself, tender and delicious! 

A large table behind us was raving about the baked ham, which led me to have slight regret that we didn't try Mother's trademark meat! So even though I have not tried it, taking it from the word of people we spoke to, ham is probably awesome here. We also saw potato salad that looked good on people's plates as we were walking by.

I couldn't resist trying some desserts while there, considering the line takes forever. We had the bread pudding and the walnut brownie. I am a brownie lover and this one was gooey and awesome....however if you're going to grab dessert I would definitely get bread pudding. It's like eating a cloud. It came close to my grandmothers and that is saying a ton. Can we say sugar coma? Haha :-)

Obviously the line is pretty long, we went around 1:30 and it was still packed. People will pass back their menus through the line though! And the price is just about the same as anywhere else around the area, if you're trying to get a poboy or seafood.

The bread didn't have the crunch I expect on a po'boy and they definitely slumped on the lettuce and tomato. My friend ordered the jambalaya and, while it was good, she wasn't severely impressed. I'll definitely have to try it again at some point and will have to try one of signature dishes.",2019-10-02 19:11:01,12.0,676,12.0,0.0967741935483871,0.0967741935483871,0.46153846153846156,0.46153846153846156

That's the cherubic ""Man Vs. Food"" guy who keeps getting into those food-eating contests at various dives throughout the country. I don't think he did his Big Easy contest at Mother's, but he must have tried one of the sandwiches here, which immediately labels this place an instant emporium of unhealthy gluttony in my book. 

Mother's does have a reputation for its $10 Debris Po' Boys, which use the meat that falls off roasts as the basis for the filling. That sounded like pure gristle to me, so we both went for the $10.75 Famous Ferdi Special, which puts their home-baked ham, roast beef, shredded cabbage, and yes, the debris, together into a soft roll that was then doused in a watery gravy (see photo). Our verdict...it was alright, kinda on the ho-hum side for all the meat provided, especially what they proclaim to be ""the world's best baked ham"".

I was not feeling it, although the $3.50 plate of French Fries helped (see photo) since it was quite a pile and piping hot to boot. I also had a $5.25 Garden Salad, which they inexplicably put in a bowl way too small to mix any of the ranch dressing in there with ease (see photo). Rather outdated and probably proud of its traditions, Mother's is a surprisingly small place considering how long it's been on this corner of Poydras Street. You order your food at the register and pick up your beverages there as well. Overall, it just wasn't a memorable experience.

After reading all the positive reviews on Mother's I've been wanting to try them for a long time.  I've been to New Orleans dozens of times and eaten at 100+ different restaurants, Mother's was the absolutely worst I've been to!

I went in tonight about 8:00PM and ordered a regular size bowl of seafood gumbo and a bottle of water, then sat down and waited for it to be served.  About 5 minutes later it was delivery, the lady delivering my gumbo asked if I wanted some bread, I said why not.

When I stirred the rice into the gumbo I noticed that there wasn't much substance to gumbo.  As I began to eat it I found three lonely shrimp, no crab (there was a very few some funny strands of something but it didn't taste like crab), no oysters, and no okra.  Take a look at the photos I've posted, a picture is worth a thousand words! On top of that it have very little flavor.  Since I'd already paid for it and when ahead and ate it, wasted calories!!

I paid $11.60 for the bowl of gravy and a bottle of water!!

I asked the sweet lady manning (womaning?) the counter for crawfish √©touff√©e with a side of red beans and had it brought it out to me ten minutes later. These ten minutes seemed like forever to me as I drooled over the savory scent of our neighboring diner's gumbo. Ten minutes, and I ate it all in five. AND I was so excited, I didn't take a picture. -hangs head in shame-

To my delight, they really pile on the crawfish in their √©touff√©e. I got at least one or two in every bite. Gotta love them crawdads! The rich seafood stock is not too heavy and does a solid job at bringing all the ingredients together, or ""smothering"" as they say. 
I never tried savory red beans prior to this and surprisingly liked them as well. I also took a bite of the Jerry's jambalaya that my friend ordered and fell in love with the smoky andouille sausage.

Staff - I politely asked if they have any vegan options, they didn't even offer me a vegetarian menu (about which I found out later online).

To be honest, we didn't feel welcome, staff was cranky. Maybe because we came probably 30 min before they closed. But come on...

The breakfast special was awful. I asked for fried ham and got baked ham instead, which flooded my plate with the water the ham was soaking in. The ham itself was super fatty. The grits were rubbery from sitting out too long and no amount of butter, salt and pepper could save them. The eggs over easy were undercooked with the whites looking like clear snot.

I returned to the city that year after grad school and word was already out that Mother's had become overrun with  tourists.  Prices jacked up, lines grew long and seating became dear.

Be prepared for a wait, because there's a lot of lines involved. Came here with 3 other people on a Tuesday around 1:30pm. Waited for about 13 min of outside before the guard let us wait inside. We waited for about 16 minutes before we got up to the cashier to order. They recommend checking your receipt before leaving to make sure your order is correct. They do take credit cards. The line never did die down, and it seemed like people just kept coming. You order first before grabbing a seat. 
The restaurant is a lot more spacious than I thought - there are a lot of tables that could fit up to 12 people as well as smaller 4 person ones. There are bathrooms available with 3 stalls. Once you're seated, a head waiter takes your receipt and directs your orders to your table.  It took about 40 min for food to come out, but that's because we got the fried chicken, which is made to order. The fried chicken was a tad too salty but I liked the crispiness of the skin. The plate of fries we got were huge and good for four people. They're thin cut and reminded me of crispier In-n-Out fries. The regular size famous ferdi special po'boy was quite heavy and could easily feed 2 people alone. I liked how the au jus soaked into the bread so it was slightly soggy but very juicy. For first-timers I would recommend the combination platter which came with a sampling of different New Orleans classics.

The cashiers make their disdain towards customers pretty apparent as my two questions (with nobody behind me, mind you) seemed to chafe the gal behind the counter. Opted for the Ferdi, a house specialty po boy layered with their famous baked ham, roast beef, debris and a heavy ladle of gravy. I mean, I guess it was fine -¬†a regular is definitely a hearty meal - but I wasn't bowled over by the meats, the bread desperately needed a good saturatin' by the beef drippings, and the whole shebang (sand sides) rang in at $13. Bloody Mary in an 8oz plastic cup tipped this kinda just okay meal over $21, and I know I could have spent the same for better.

She was completely unimpressed with their three stack of pancakes. One of the two questions I asked: ""can she get a side of bacon with her 'cakes?"" You'd think I ran over her dog. ""We do NOT serve bacon.""

** If you learn nothing else, learn this: Mother's does not serve bacon. That is all. **

Okay, not all. We went sausage instead and I actually preferred the house-made links to anything else on the menu.

The last and most peculiar point: you order at a counter, a server brings you the food. There are signs everywhere that says ""We at Mother's do not accept gratuities."" There's a story about it in the menu. So you can imagine how squirmy we got when our server mentioned said signs, and said, ""While it's the restaurants tradition, we do actually accept tips."" Well, this is fucking awkward.

It started with the hosts, that told us there was a 45 minute wait, so we walked around for about 15 minutes, and discovered that we got called during that time.  We got put to the back of the line. That was our fault to a point, so we accepted it and waited.  Once we were seated, there were several negative things that happened during the wait for our food, but suffice to say that it took about an hour to get our food, and it was wrong.  We ordered sandwiches, so you wouldn't expect it to take that long, but theoretically other's food was ahead of ours, but we noticed that a couple of our sandwiches were on the counter for at least 20 minutes, since we watched them grab them when our order finally came.   The waiter never got us a refill, and he disappeared for most of our time there.  We even watched him go across the street for some reason.  We went to the counter to get our own refills, and the staffer barked at us.  The tickets were wrong, but we didn't want to bother to correct it.  By the expression when we asked about paying, it was obvious that the waiter didn't want to handle the bill, so we got in line to pay.  We were 2nd in line, yet we stood in line about 20 minutes to start to pay our tickets, and then about 15 to 20 more minutes to pay, because they couldn't figure out how to handle separate tickets.  They charged my card the wrong amount, so then had to refund it and recharge it. There were people complaining all around us for many other reasons. The food was good, but not great.  My soft shell crab poboy was not that good, but the sides were good.  Had the food been great, I might've given it 1 or 2 more stars, however the service and bad attitudes were the worst that I've experienced in my life.  You'll get an occasional bad waiter or other bad staffer, but they were all incompetent, ornery, lazy and/or unpleasant.  In a city full of great restaurants, I can't imagine such a place surviving.

You'll also know that we were hungry the entire time in Nola due to long lines to eat because of Memorial Day Weekend.  Here we go, we turn the corner and guess what...there's a huge line in front of Mothers!  OH NOoooo!  We were at that point though that we said let's just wait in line. When we got to the back of the line, an employee was passing around menus to speed up the process.  We were told there was a 45 minute wait, ""Growl"" said my stomach.  Luckily, the staff must of eaten their Wheaties that morning because the line moved fast. We waited 20 minutes outside and another 10 inside, better than expected. 

You order at the counter and then choose a table. Many tables are communal and we ended up sharing one with a nice group from NYC. The feels of Mother's is authentic southern food, like it has so much history and so many people have dined there. They have old school photos on the walls and 3 dining rooms to choose from.  

The meal came 20 minutes later and it was just what I needed to calm the stomach monster.  Fried chicken, potato salad, beans, green beans and a local beer, Dixie.   I doused the fried chicken with some local hot sauce that was on the table that gave the chicken a kick.  Washed it down with Dixie Lager that was light but not unflavored.  The green beans were to die for. Best green bean salad I've ever had. They were warm with a slight vinegar taste. 

Extremely satisfying meal at Mother's. I was a different person walking out than I was coming in!

So of course I had to hit one of the most talked about spots here. Last night after a long day of working with kids me and a friend accidentally ran into Mothers on our last night. It was on the list but we just honestly hit Bourbon and Frenchman street every night. We walked in about an hour before closing and the line was nice and short and it was a little stagnant. Of course being the most indecisive person ever I took about 10 min to decide what I wanted and by that time a family of like six showed up and the line got a lil thick but it still moved really quickly. My friend Kisha is all about asking people what is the best to get and Marvin and the sweet security guard we're really great about answering all of our questions. 

Now I'm not the biggest seafood fan but we decided to do a shrimp poboy, a chicken breast poboy and crawfish etoufee, yes we regret not getting the catfish one not because the chicken one was bad but because it's about the seafood.

I needed some kind of remoulade or sauce because the tarter and cocktail doesn't cut it and if I put anymore hot sauce on that poboy I would melt a toilet.

They have a katrina story section now on their menu--their restaurant was just hit with residual water damage from the storm but they housed their long time employees in the Mother's parking lot which I thought was cool.

I was going to re-write a review but all the below is still super accurate and in line with my experience this past time--except I was disappointed not to see Elvis. :-( 
_____Original review____
Best sandwich I've ever had! And yet, there is so much more. It's just a fun experience going there, standing in line on a hot day, listening to the crazy Elvis guy shout out about how their bloody mary's are the best, etc. It's all just foreplay to the main event.

When you finally get inside, you see the bustling restaurant. The people making the sandwiches screaming about, the line moving, some tourists confused at the process of ordering, etc. Admittedly the first time I came here I was nervous when I ordered, as I didn't want to get yelled at. :-O

My fave is the Ferdi Special (baked ham, roast beef, debris--the parts of the meat that fall off--gravy). You can't beat this--just heavenly delicious. I have a friend that's a fan of the breakfast with grits so that's good too. Some other friends swear upon the fried shrimp or oyster po-boy, but I can't seem to take myself away from that debris sandwich. 

We go here several times for lunch--or a snack just to fit another in-- whenever in town.

By the way, I'm not a bloody mary person but I once had the greatest mimosa here. If you ever get a chance to be escorted to the back restaurant where there is a full on bar, take it! Lots of champagne and just a bit of oj to give it color. ;-) Hey, you're in New Orleans--booze is king!

Mother's came highly recommended, based off the fact that it was apparently featured on a Travel Channel food show of some sort.  And let me just say...why?

Rant begin:

So I don't mind the line.  The line is not an issue.  Some people may think that a line guarantees quality, but having lived around the LA food scene I can very much guarantee you it does not.  But as lines go, this wasn't a long wait, even if it looks like one.

I don't mind that service was a little weird.  Now no one working here seemed like bad people, but it's a definite culture shock coming from California where service is apparently super friendly and then in NOLA it's just sort of ""I'll help you, but I don't have to like it"".  Nothing for me to get angry at, just a bit of a shift.  But that's still not the problem.

The problem was the Ferdi Special.  I'm going to be here possibly once in my life, I'm going to go for the Ferdi Special because it's at the top of the menu and it is a specialty of Mother's.  Therefore, this is them saying ""This is our best effort, enjoy"".  And...

Who in their right mind looked at ""Au Jus"" and seriously thought ""Hey, you know that runny, wet sauce people like to dip roast beef sandwiches into?  Hear me out, let's puddle it onto the bottom of the plate and let the sandwich just sit in it.  Just let it swim in those juices.  Just let that bread soak it all in and disintegrate before your very eyes.  Because that's what sandwiches were made for.  They were made so you can't pick them up.""  Like I'm all for open faced but sandwiches are literally made to be eaten with hands what is this?!  It's a mess.  It's a mess of salty meat.  Was it good?  No.  Not even close.  I came in wanting a nice hot meal and I get half of a sandwich and it's not very good.  And just so I'm clear, this wasn't a bit of soggy bread.  This bread was full on paste by the time it got to me.  You CAN'T pick it up, it just crumbles into goop.

And part of me wants to give them the benefit of the doubt and say ""Well maybe they have good gumbo or something"" but this was the specialty at the top of the menu!  If I went to an actual mother's house and said ""Cook me your specialty"" and they're all ""Okay, let me make you some delicious meatloaf"" and the meatloaf comes out and it's made of paper towels and used syringes you don't get a chance to offer me some soup.  You had your shot and squandered it.

I give them two stars because there is still care and hope for this business and obviously someone must like it, and the food wasn't inedible I suppose.  But the Ferdi Special is not the way to go.  Some other reviews might disagree, but they lie.  That's right, I'm calling you out.  You know you're valid opinion?  It's wrong.  You have a wrong opinion.  and your favorite movie isn't very good either.  I'm feeling salty.  It's probably from all the salty meat.",2016-08-01 22:35:06,24.0,3104,24.0,0.038461538461538464,0.038461538461538464,0.4307748951706429,0.4307748951706429

Admittedly, I made some mistakes here. I visited on the last day of my trip, and about two hours before the start of a Saint's home game on a Sunday afternoon. O.K., BIG mistake. Don't do this unless you want to waste way too much time in line.

First, you wait outside, which took about 30 minutes. Then you finally get inside expecting to sit down, only to wait in another line to place your order, and that took about 15 minutes. It's quite a process, but well controlled. No line cutters here.

The place itself is dated and looks like it hasn't been touched in 30 years, but the food looks good and smells delicious. 

Once you place your order, you sit down at any open table carrying your drink, and a server comes around to collect your receipt and brings out your food in about 10 -15 minutes. 

I ordered a grilled chicken po' boy, a biscuit, grits and a mimosa. It was WAY too much food. Everything was fine, but nothing wowed me by any means. I especially didn't care for the grits, and felt they had no flavor besides butter and weren't worth the very many calories.

Bit dark and dingy,
but it has it's authentic charm.

Basically, you order, pay and sit down
and wait for your waitress and food.

FOOD
=====
FRIED CHICKEN (2 pcs and 2 sides) - $11
Fried chicken lacked that spicy cajun seasoning
that I've been craving for. The rice and
beans and the greens weren't that memorable either.
But I loved that biscuit.
RATING: 3/5

MAE's FILE GUMBO - $6 (cup)
Chicken and smoked sausage was again ""OK"".
The sausage lacked any real spice and it tasted
like it was just being reheated in a pot. Not too
fresh.
RATING: 3/5

STAFF
=====
Super friendly.
RATING: 5/5

My husband enjoyed his Po Boy more than I did
my fried chicken and gumbo. So maybe that's
a better bet next time.

The fried chicken pretty good full of flavor, fish not so great, it wasn't fried good need a lot of flavor.  Now that Gumbo, I'm sorry I did not like it, no flavor, smelled to fishy it turned me off, I added Tabasco still bad.  I was very upset with that.

First, I have to say that time of day is everything!  The later the day goes on the longer the line will be.  What takes the most amount of time, is placing your order.  Once inside, you have to wait in line and move toward the register to place your order.  There is only one register and cashier that take both the order and the money; thus why the wait is long.  Additional note, it is very cold inside, therefore I suggest you bring a coat.
After ordering your food, you try to locate a table and then when seated a server will come by your table to provide you with your eating unitizes and take your ticket to grab your food. So, no seat saving is allowed. 

Food:  The food is okay.  I can say that I've had better in NOLA.  Some dishes will come out hot, while other dishes will come out cold.  For example, my waffle arrived warm, while my mother's eggs arrived cold; so she needed to use her grits to warm them up.  The food can be a tad bit salty, especially the roast beef and au ju sauce.  However, all food items are made to order, but are kept in cafeteria style warming dishes.  Lastly, there is no call ahead and take out ordering available.

First, I went on a Friday at noon and the wait was not bad (only waited about 15 min to get inside and order) considering it was at lunchtime.  Second, the service was fast, nice and helpful.  I had forgotten to order something when I went through the line originally, but ather than having to wait in line, a waitress helped me out to get what I needed without having to get back in line.

If so, Mother's will be hard to beat.

It's a serving line, sort of cafeteria style, but you never have to worry about the food getting stale or cooked down on the steam table. Everything moves so quickly, it's fresh on your plate. I couldn't make up my mind, so I had a Combination Platter with Jambalaya, Crawfish Etoufee, Red Beans and Rice, Potato Salad, and Green Beans w/Tomatoes. It was absolutely amazing. The red beans and rice were the best I've ever had, the green beans had flavor that I didn't know you could get into green beans, and the Crawfish Etoufee literally made me want to weep for joy. So much delicious food. The only complaint that I would make was that the potato salad almost seemed wasted. That, however, may just be me.

For dessert, I had bread pudding. I love bread pudding, and based on taste alone, I could have eaten another portion. That said, by the end of the meal, I was seriously considering unbuttoning my pants.

I used to be a big eater, but forsook such activities a while back. If ever there were a reason to cause myself pain at the dinner table again, Mother's would be it.

The fried seafood po'boys are perfectly fried with a little mayo, shredded cabbage and pickles. You can ask for cocktail or tartar if you want. It is fun to get a meat one and a fried one and share! We also tried the red beans and rice this time and it was delish with large pieces of sausage. It was thick and rich, perfectly seasoned and sooo tasty. It comes with slices of french bread.

Typically, there may be a line out the door that you have to wait in, but on a Tuesday at 2pm, I lucked out and walked right in.

It didn't take long to get our food-an order of Creole shrimp, and a couple po boy sandwiches for our group.

Mother's has a system, but no ones going to tell you about it. Here's how it appears to work: wait in line.

My NOLA native friend told me Mother's is a must. A line out the door is always a good sign, right? 

Served cafeteria style, but brought to your table by servers, this place is a NOLA institution.  Yes, it's a must to visit, but more for overall experience, and less for the world famous Ferdi Special.  It's an all meat Po Boy with Mother's famous ham, roast beef, debris, and gravy.  It's huge, it's sopping wet with meat juice, and yet, I found it dry.  Yes, I know.  It doesn't seem possible, but, I found the meat itself, dry and a big flavorless.  As another yelper stated, I had to Krystallize it to finish just the half.  If you try it, just get one to share.  

Our pre-game lunch also consisted of the Seafood platter with crawfish etouffee and jambalaya.  This will easily feed 2 or more peeps. Its a huge platter that is also served with 2 sides.  The seafood consisted of shrimp, oysters, and catfish, all perfectly fried. The jambalaya and etouffee were pretty good, not great. The red beans and rice, however, was delicious.   All this for the low low price of $25.50. Don't do what we did, and order this as a meal for one person.  Not unless you plan on having it for dinner too.  

Other items on the table were the debris po boy and roast beef po boy, both of with were just ok.  We finished up the meal with the bread pudding, and again, I found it just ok.  Heavy on the fruit cocktail, and extra sweet.  

Our server was fantastic.  So good, that we wanted to tip him very well, but as the sign says, don't tip the servers.  Apparently they won't accept them.  Well, I think they must be paid pretty well considering the average price for a po boy is $11.",2012-12-12 06:26:20,41.0,1730,41.0,0.12166172106824925,0.12166172106824925,0.9857364255104072,0.9857364255104072

What I was duped into thinking was a heralded staple of the city of New Orleans was actually a muddled, lazy mess.

Unkempt, indifferent staff makes you feel like you're right back home at the DMV. The same glazed, comatosed demeanor - would have preferred an animatronic Chuck E. Cheese doll - at least those smile. $5 to the first customer who gets the checkout lady to look you in the eyes. But I was here for a sandwich, not to get my car out of the impound lot as the staff's conduct would have suggested. 

Well, it started out well enough - an armed police officer kindly told me to stand against a wall. As one does at all fine dining establishments. There I found a line of other duped patrons. A menu is flung at us with the same carelessness. We're being treated with the same delicateness the pigs on their menu were treated, so I suppose it's only fair. 

My order is taken abruptly, and I'm given a receipt and a cup of water. (The water lady was actually really sweet). I sit. I wait. 15 minutes. Only then does the frazzled waitress come to me with her eyes looking everywhere but into my own. ""Can I have your ticket?"" You mean my order hasn't even gone in yet? 20 minutes and four reminders later, she finally brings me my sandwich. 

Okay great - moment of truth. I can look past all the dilapidated social compasses. As long as the food is good. Because fuck it, you can give me a trash can lid as a plate and a tire iron as a fork, if the food is good I'm as tickled as a teenage girl's first bike ride. So throw it at me! Earn your incompetence! Earn your lack of basic hygiene and social currency! Make me not care that you don't care! Bring on the food! Bring on the sandwich! 

Pale, textureless, flavorless bread - as though Subway rolls had sex with a bag of Wonderbread, but much whiter and more boring. A trillion miles from the stapled New Orleans super crusty French bread that can be seen all over the city. 

But, at least the bread came served in a plate filled with a quarter inch of water for the bread to sit in. That's right, what was supposed to be a nice crusty roll, is just a Wonderbread waste product sitting in a pool of water. The bottom of the bread now completely soaked reminiscent of a freshly christened diaper. This was supposedly their ""gravy"". However, mine was simply clear tap water that a piece of meat may or may not have been in at some point. 

But, at least the meat was cold. Yes, nothing says warm Louisiana po boy like a cold Louisiana po boy. It was just awful as I sat there thinking of what canned microwaveable meal I'd be eating when I came home to supplement this travesty. 

Let it be known that this was my Second venture to this restaurant. The first, a similarly poor experience, I chalked it up to a bad day, bad timing, so I returned to give them a second chance. Silly rabbit. 

I guess I'm mad because this place had a name, but now it's just a name, whatever flavors and energy started this place years ago have long fled. It used to have story, a legend. But if you stick a piece of shit in Superman's cape, it's not going to fly.

I only discovered Mother's by walking past. It is unfortunately not reviewed very well and so it lists behind others when it really needs to be higher. This isn't a fancy restaurant and it isn't touristy so I believe some folks are comparing it to those others unfairly. This is a simple place and it's absolutely delicious. If you're looking for a cheap and filling meal without all the gaudiness of Bourbon Street, Mother's.

Like most businesses, they win or lose based on the staff. This evening's staff won. We were handily served by Renee and Marvin. Starting off with drinks. I don't care for Bloody Mary's because I don't like tomato juice but I was talked into having one tonight. And it was very good. Quite spicy, very peppery and woooooo, strong. My dining mate wouldn't be convinced to try one and so Renee made up a special drink for her and she enjoyed it. We don't know what it was other than Absolut and some juices, so we're calling it ""The Renee.""

As for the food, I chose the baked ham dinner. With three sides, this is a massive mountain of food. The collard greens had ham in them, the red beans and rice had ham in them and the potato salad did not. Still, it was creamy and potatoey (is that a word?) and of course the baked ham at the center of the plate was excellent. When the place says ""best baked ham in the world"" then it darned well better be. And it was. Thick, meat, not fatty. Delicious. And holy cow, a solid $15 plate of lots of food!

We opted not to have dessert here as there were other plans.

Mother's is underrated. It was inexpensive, it was tasty and there was plenty of it. Sure, there are fancier joints in the city. But Mother's is worth it.

Sad to say, I wish I didn't skip my free work lunch because Mother's was overrated. The famous ferdi special po' boy (ham, roast beef, original debris with au jus gravy for $13) was bland and lukewarm. We also shared the combination platter so we could try a little bit of everything. It included jambalaya, red beans & rice, potato salad, crawfish √©touf√©e, and grits, all for $20.

These are some of the reasons that I run right back to Mother's whenever I land in New Orleans.

I think about this place in the months between my visits.
It's been an institution since 1938.
It's a no-frills, casual, fabulous  restaurant serving up some of the best comfort food in town.  

This is where you'll find me most mornings for breakfast but it's great in my opinion any time of day or night.

If there's a line when you show up, fear not; it will move quickly.
Yummy, yummy, yummy Cajun, Creole, Southern food. You will not leave hungry.  You will leave happy and full. 

Please ignore the signs in the dining areas saying ""No tipping""...I don't get it and neither do the hard-working friendly staff.  They will graciously and gratefully accept tips just like anyone else in the restaurant biz.  

Spend some time talking to the wait-staff while you're there enjoying your good food and hefty portions.

-Ralph - This is a Po Boy with baked ham, debris, roast beef and cheese. The debris releases some au jus, so the bread on the bottom WILL get soggy. I didn't mind this, but some in our group did.

They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner; however, I do not ever recall eating breakfast there.  Way back in the 80's, I was a semi-regular patron and loved to go here, especially when friends were visiting from out of town.

The breakfast offerings are pretty much what you would expect from any local diner or restaurant.  Nothing spectacular, but they do have a very good made from scratch biscuit.  Lunch, in my opinion, is what keeps Mother's going.  Their self-touted ""World's Best Baked Ham"", as I recall from my last visit a few years ago was pretty solid, especially since I not a ham freak.  Their signature dish is their original Debris with au jus gravy.  For those not in the know, the original Debris is a roast beef po-boy made from ""the roast beef that falls into the au jus gravy in the pan while roasting in the oven"".  This is a deliciously good, sloppy, dripping sandwich and is probably their #1 or #2 seller if I had to guess.  Their other signature sandwich is the ""Famous Ferdi Special"".  This po-boy is similar to the original Debris, but it adds their famous baked ham.  Speaking of ham, Mother's offers three varieties of their ham:

1.  Baked: (sliced)
2.  Black: (crust)
3.  Fried: (thick)

Their black ham, which I am not sure is signature to Mother's is ""the seasoned, caramelized crust sliced from the World's Best Baked ham"".  This tends to sell out quickly, so you better order at breakfast if you really want it.  

Regarding dinner, Mother's is not my recommendation.  They do offer po-boys, salads, daily specials, red beans & rice, gumbo, jambalaya and etoufees.   However, I feel they are just average at best.  If you are a tourist one stop to Mother's is ok if you want to ""check off that box"" of places to eat.  However, the lines, especially at lunch are super long.

Originally we wanted to eat at a different restaurant but the wait time was too long so we decided to try Mother's since it was close and within walking distance. When you get in, the ordering process is like a cafeteria where you can see some of the food that's already been prepared. I got the two eggs breakfast with cheese grits and their sweet ham and side of pork links. My food was ok, nothing to really brag about. The only complaint I had about my food was the ham was dry.

Others in my party ordered the pancakes and someone else got the same special I got but their order got messed up so much they just canceled it (the kitchen could not get her eggs right, she asked for fried and she got it sunny side up, over medium, and then scrambled ). As for the pancakes, they tasted like cardboard (I kid you not) I'm not sure how you can mess up pancakes but Mother's managed to do so.

The po'boy came with several slices of thin sliced roast beef and then about an  1/2 inch of what appeared to be meat from a chuck roast. The they put some mustard and something else on the sandwich while drowning it is beef broth. That made for one soggy po'boy.

My spouse had a turkey po'boy(2/3 size) which was stacked with real turkey, not eh compressed stuff you get many times. It too though had a lot of mustard and sauces on it but at least it was not soggy like my po'boy. Both sandwiches were hugh and we had no ideal how we could each them. We got though half Ok and then struggled with the remainder. In the meantime the restaurant kept filling with customers and there was even a line as we left.

You order and pay for you meal at the end of the line. Drinks were also filled at that point. The meal was interesting and good at the same time.

We arrived here as a recommendation from our Uber driver. He really appeared excited about Mother's. His eyes lit up and you could almost see him salivate. I was like, yes! I want to try this.

We ordered roast beef po boy with aus jus (beef juice with flour- a gravy) and side of baked ham. The roast beef was good. The beef was thinly sliced, the au jus offered all the juiciness and flavors. 

The problem was the gravy soaked into the crispy bread so by the time the sandwich hits your table, your sandwich is a soggy mess. You can try to eat it with your hands but it will definitely sag and you will resort to fork and knife.

The baked ham looked dry in pictures. We ordered it and it was really really really dry. All the gravy from the po boy couldn't save it. It tasted like chewing a stack of napkins. K was a trooper and ate it all with an soup of hot sauce.

----The Food----
Famous Ferdi Debris Special ($13.00)- This is the signature item.  It's a po' boy jam packed with baked ham, roast beef, shredded lettuce, and debris with au jus gravy.  Debris is the roast beef that falls into the gravy while baking into the oven.  So imagine the most tender piece of meat you've ever had and multiply that by 10.  That's how supple the roast beef is here at Mothers.  The gravy is good, but I felt it needed more seasoning as Johnny's Po-boys had better tasting gravy, in my opinion.  My major complaints would be how the ham contained bits of ligaments, making some bites unenjoyable and the bread used here could be softer.  Other than that, pretty good roast beef--I'd be happy to eat that alone with some rice. 

Combo Fried Shrimp and Oyster Po-boy ($18.00)- I've never seen a place be so generous with their fried shrimp and oyster!  Both are large, filling and overly battered with what tastes like Creole Seasoning.  I'm not one to complain about something being too battered and deep fried, but I think Mother's scales the line with that as their stuff took time to chew. At meal's end, my jaws and inner cheeks were in pain. I know...first world problems. Lol. I finished this item, but felt the fried shrimp is better at Killer Poboys and the fried oysters are better at Stanleys.  Still admirable here though, especially how they give you so much.

Conclusion: Closer to 3.5 Stars and kind of a tourist trap. Despite being named Mother's, I did not receive any motherly type of care at this establishment.  The service here is poor, pushy, impatient, and unfriendly.  Maybe they should rename this place to Step-Mother's Restaurant. Lol.  Anyhow, both the sandwiches are worth a try, just be prepared for a heavy meal.

Extra Notes:
-Accepts credit card
-Inside may make you feel claustrophobic as it can get crowded.
-Decor seems outdated and slightly dirty.  Wish it was brighter inside too.
-Atmosphere is kind of hectic and employees aren't the best
-Restrooms could be cleaner",2015-04-17 00:46:44,24.0,2159,24.0,0.06349206349206349,0.06349206349206349,0.51651735753911,0.51651735753911

If you park across the street in the Preminum parking spot, and you go over your time limit, be ready to fork over 90 dollars to have a boot removed.

i loved the home, cafeteria style of the place. no thrills here, just come an eat and find yourself a table.

however, the bloody marys were the worst ive ever had. i dont think there was any liquor in them and they were so syrupy, tasted more like thick tomatoe soup. i was just so let down, they were so sad and a pretty steep price too. The shrimp poboy wasnt much better. shrimp needed to be fried more, barely any fixings on it, and the breading was kinda soggy. my friend got the breakfast platter and i tried her grits. no flavor, grits were hard, and just no effort. the rest of the plate was meat based, which i dont eat, but lets just say she took 2 spoon fools and stopped. she was not happy.  my other 2 friends were kinda let down about their meals too.

Quick education on ""Debris"": Debris refers to shredded roast beef that's been moistened with pan drippings and/or simmered extra long so it absorbs more gravy and seasoning - and it's GOOOOOOOD.

And that's a compliment! I liked the old feel about it, the casual  no-nonsense vibe, and the simple yet very tasty food[1]. This place is somewhere in between a restaurant, a diner, and a cafeteria.

Ordering food here is somewhat cumbersome:
- you stay in a line to order the food,
- you stay in a line to pay,
- you grab a seat wherever you want and
- wait until a server comes and gets your receipt and will then bring the food to your table[2].

I tried their Ferdi Special with baked ham, roast beef, debris, and gravy ($10.75). This po-boy is large enough to be shared. This is an excellent po-boy: the ham is tasty and tender, and the roast beef juicy. The debris ( i.e. ""the roast beef that falls into the gravy while baking in the oven"") sounded really yummy but was kind of lost in the po-boy. My only complain is the bread: I think this sandwich could definitely use a bread with a crunchy crust rather than this limp, industrial quality French bread[3].

The jambalaya ($6.25) was perhaps the best I've had in NOLA: simple, packed with flavor, and yet each ingredient kept its own identity in this dish. Also, the rice was cooked to perfection, with the grains nicely separated.

The turnip greens side ($3.25) was decent, and the bread pudding ($4.75) surprising: the consistency was very soft, unlike any of the bread puddings I've tried at any of the West Indian places in Brooklyn. I enjoyed it.

Mother's is certainly not cheap for such a no-frills place, but it's worth a visit. This place is very popular: come early, and be prepared to long lines.

We visited New Orleans and Florida between Christmas to New Years.  

As I walked the dog in the morning we passed Mother's.  A search on Yelp late shared that they have a wide menu.

We walked in and ordered and they delivered to our van when the food was ready.  The internal atmosphere was nice and the staff wonderfully friendly.

We took our time getting checked out of the hotel, and sought to get food and watch the Mississippi roll by for a few minutes before heading off to Florida.

Crowded parking transpired against us... so, the kids ate their great Po'boys as we drove across the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway... and once we got to the other side and parked for a couple minutes my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed their etoufee - so good... so fresh... nice!

When I walked inside, I was greeted and asked to write down my name and number on a notepad (for contact tracing). Then I was asked if I was dining in and when I said, ""Yes,"" I was seated at a table and told my server Ms. Pat would be with me shortly.

Ms. Pat came to the table and I definitely would've thought she was one of my aunties. She had the sweetest, most motherly demeanor. She recommended some things and took my order. I went with a cup of the fil√© gumbo and a catfish po' boy. It took a minute for my food to come up and when Ms. Pat saw that it hadn't arrived she went back to check on it and came right on out with it.

The gumbo was GOOD! I should've ordered a bowl instead of just the cup. The po' boy was a little disappointing. I liked the bread and how well the catfish was fried; however, it was super bland. I looked up on the counter and noticed sweet potato pie, so I decided to order a slice. It was cool.

It looks small with limited seating inside but I found out that the restaurant was bigger than I thought. There was plenty of seating in the back. 
I found a small table near the register and close to a tv. Score!
I ordered the fried chicken plate. The chicken was great. Crunchy yet juicy. The green beans were seasoned and prepared well. I also had the shrimp creole that had a great spice to it.

The service was great and the place is pretty open, the restaurant is not fancy but the atmosphere was great.

The food:

Ralph- Ham, roast beef, debris with au jus gravy with choice of Swiss or American cheese. Ralph is basically a cheese version of their famous ferdi special. I asked the counter guy which I should go for and he said I should go with the Ralph since the cheese adds a nice richness, I picked American because I am a sucker for beef and American cheese. Overall, I thought the sandwich was just OK, I thought roast beef was pretty dry and kinda chewy but the ham was really good. I thought the debri could have used some fatty pieces too, I also didn't like how soggy the sandwich was. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=G0VxZP7m0KYjJiMJ2e9wmQ&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA

The entire meal was EXCELLENT!!! Soooooo flavorful, fresh and seasoned just right!!!

The roast beef was tender, juicy and absolutely DE-LISH!!!

The turnip greens were THE BEST greens!!! Soooooo flavorful! I could've easily eaten an entire bowl of greens as a meal.

The red beans and rice were soooooo YUMMY!!! 

The potato salad tasted sooooo FRESH!!!

It is true that there will be a long line, and that you have to order cafeteria style. the place gets crowded, but try to get a seat in the back dining room where the bar is. It's so pretty, spacious and slightly industrial with a super high ceiling and exposed brick. we sat at a high table near the double doors with windows and enjoyed the sun streaming in.

We were seated by 11 and out by 12, so the wait wasn't too long. Our server was funny and struck up a conversation with us. we wanted to tip him but did feel uncomfortable with the no tipping rule. 

As for our food. Generous portion sizes, and everything was tasty. fluffy omelets (I was partial to my crawfish entouffe omelet). the baked ham was purty good too. the biscuits were pillowy and so yummy with butter and raspberry jelly. Our grits weren't dressed but just adding a pat or two of butter and salt made em perfect. Mimosas, while high at $6.50, packed a nice little punch but were super good with brunch.  I liked Mother's.  Pricewise it was more than i thpought for some items, but overall similar to other eateries here.

New Orleans has a wealth of places to find a nice po boy.  My first stop on the NOLA tour was Mother's Restaurant, and I will admit both joy and disappointment.

As a disciple of Adam Richman, I had to go to Mother's.  Following his path can be a joy and a burden.  The main sandwich highlighted during Man v. Food was the Ferdi:  root beer glazed ham and debris (tiny shred of beef) with all the fixings.  This sandwich looked amazing on television, but deep down inside I knew I wouldn't freak out about this po boy.

My companions both chose different sandwiches.  Our NOLA friend got a po boy of just debris, and the misses got the fried shrimp po boy.  As soon as the sandwiches arrived, I was immediately pulling shrimp from her po boy.  We ultimately decided to share our sandwiches three ways.  

The debris itself was pretty delicious, but it felt like something that I could have easily done on my own. However, perhaps that's the point of Mother's.  The shrimp was soooooo great!  I could have ate three of those by myself.

And now the Ferdi.  I thought the Ferdi was okay.  Separately, each component would work as its own sandwich, but the parts together didn't ring my bell.  The debris has a nice flavor, but it really overshadowed the ham, which is supposed to be famous.  I would have like to try the ham by itself.

As for the prices, Mother's takes advantage of its notoriety.  The Ferdi was $11.75, and he shrimp po boy was $14.00.  I can justify a pricey bit of seafood, but twelve dollars for some beef and ham, that's a little outrageous.  Being located in the Central Business District doesn't help, too.  I spent forty dollars on three sandwiches, no drinks or sides.  That was the biggest disappointment.

I learned my lesson, NOLA.  More about my journeys later . . .",2013-01-03 22:59:36,24.0,1821,24.0,0.07017543859649122,0.07017543859649122,0.5624141889516143,0.5624141889516143

Overall a good spot to grab some NOLA food if the line isn't too long and they are one of the few spots to offer both a sliced roast beef and a roast beef debris as poboy options (the sliced roast beef has debris on top of it).

I have had people tell me they love this place more than anywhere else and I've had people tell me they'd never go there again.  On this specific trip, we were content. 

We ordered some grits with debris and their famous ""Ferdi Special"" Po-Boy which comes with ham, roast beef, and debris.  To drink I will say that the Bloody Mary was just middle of the road.  Flavor wasn't bad but a little heavy on the horseradish, average size, average price.  

The grits with debris was a solid dish.  The jus coming off the debris mixed in with the grits was a really nice bite.  I would order this again.

The Ferdi Special was good, but I don't know that it was so good that they would say this is ""their thing"".  The bite of the Ferdi after dipping it into the jus from the debris was a much better bite though.  I'd recommend you ordering a side of the jus with this sandwich.  I also added some of the herbed oil on the table for the last couple bites and that was nice too.  Made it closer to a Chicago Beef style sandwich with the jus and the oil.

The roast beef poboy came out first. My boyfriends sister ordered it. She got the smaller size and its was HUGE. She took half off her plate and to let the rest of the table share it. Holy cow was it AMAZING. It was the best thing on the table. The sandwich was juicy and had great contrast with the pickles and mustard. I was immediately regretful I didn't order it after I tasted it. 

The rest of our food came out much slower. My omelet was forgettable honestly but it's pretty tough to follow up that poboy. It came with grits which I am never a fan of so I didn't even try them. And a biscuit. The biscuit was large and came with a side of jelly.

Since I have never been here before I asked what is the most popular item that everybody likes.  

Crickets....

I asked again and she said ""what did you say?""

Her response to my question was ""Ham"" and off to space she went.

I was a bit overwhelmed by the size of the menu.  I asked her ""ham as in a sandwich or what?""

There is a long line and they need to do a better job at seating people. When we got called in, they called 4 other groups at the same time. So when we got inside, there were 5 empty tables all at once. This poses the issue of why didn't they seat people as the tables became empty? You just made all these people wait when we could have been seated inside already. Also, you put tons of strain on the kitchen when you are taking orders from 5 tables all at once, 2/5

Some of the food is made beforehand and then plated like cafeteria style. It isn't made to order. An example of this is the scrambled eggs.

A lot of these places saw some damage, and kept it up the best they could without totally changing it. So here's my review:

Good food. Fun place. Crowded, but not when we went. Yes we had to wait but it was maybe 30 minutes outside before we went inside. The officer helping with the door was really nice and told us some stories while we were waiting. 

You go inside and wait some more, again, not long. The managers hand out menus while you're outside so you have a chance to look and are ready to order when you get in. Staff is there to hep cut you off between the kitchen line doorway and the counter so cooks can come through with more food. Not one person was rude to me there. 

I ordered our food, mine the combination with crawfish etouffe and my husband's the seafood platter. A bit pricey but hats to be expected when you're ordering nothing but seafood. 

Both meals were delicious. I liked the jambalaya, the red beans and rice, and etouffe, my potato salad, and my cabbage. My husband's fried catfish and oysters were really good, too.

Server wasn't around much but it was busy. They had 3 dining rooms for Pete's sake! But everyone helped on another out and we had multiple people ask us if we were okay.

The food  was good and the service was very good. It's a little confusing as to what to do when you get in because they give you menus but they say it's cafeteria style. Kind of oxymoronic. 

My most recent visit was the day after thanksgiving. When we arrived we wanted an ATM so that we could get cash out to tip the server but the man at the door told us not to worry about that because they pay the staff minimum wage or higher so that customers don't have to worry about getting cash to tip. He stated that there are signs that say do not leave a tip. Ok then... We ordered our food and went to find a table. The cashiers make you feel very rushed and I wasn't pleased with that. The wait wasn't long at all and there weren't many people in the restaurant. There were a lot of tables dirty so we found one that was slightly clean. The server comes over to us and I told him that the table wasn't  clean. He leaves and returns with a cloth and cleans it. He never says one word to us. He then brings us our food, still never saying one word to us. Later, he puts our receipt on the table and still says nothing. As we get up to leave, the sever comes over and starts huffing and puffing and says that we didn't leave him a tip. As sorry as his service was, even if I had cash I wouldn't have left him a dime of my hard earned money. 

We went to the front and talked to the man at the door about it and he just shook his head and said not to worry. I'm pretty sure the server gets complaints regularly because I can't see him just having a bad day to this extent. 

Unfortunately we probably won't go back. The food was mediocre and the service was horrible. My food wasn't hot, it was warm. And I've had better cabbage and Greene. There are so many other places to eat in NOLA.

I knew after using all my tools in my arsenal that I had to stop at Mother's while I was near. I highly recommend asking the staff you engage with what they eat or order from Mother's!

Louisiana was monitoring their COVID cases regularly and required masks everywhere. I noticed Mother's was operating with mainly takeout orders because their dining room was operating 6-8 tables with spacing. I eat like a heathen if I've been driving for ten hours, so the idea of no one being in shock or awe of my method and taking my order to go was the right choice. 

We ordered three sandwiches on French bread. All were crafted with Mother's famous slow simmered pot roast beef. I ended up with sliced turkey, sliced roast beef and a side container of pot roast with pan juice. I tried to turn it into a French dip but the cabbage and mayo fought me. I have no regrets except that I didn't ask for an extra side of au jus to really make my dream happen. 

I love the interior of their restaurant. It had the feel of home but still highly functional as pace picked up. Mother's has a chunk of history built into the experience of walking it. It felt like someplace I wanted to come back to over and over. Every member of their team was warm and engaging. The staff was so amazing and I got so wrapped up in telling about my trip that I left my wallet and drove to Shreveport without a care. They went the extra mile to get in touch with me and let me know. 

If you love the hometown feel of great food, wonderful staff and warm feelings- Mother's should be on your list of must visit stops. I will be back next time I am in town.


Tips:

*The roast beef is worth every penny and all the compliments. Do not miss it if your even slightly a fan of Sunday dinners of yesteryears.

*The menu posted on their website was outdated and prices were higher, so that is something to consider if your calling in to make an order. 

*I would suggest getting a smaller portion of their famous Ferdi and something breakfast oriented to share.",2020-07-12 14:36:23,26.0,2106,26.0,0.06598984771573604,0.06598984771573604,0.5665577237325317,0.5665577237325317

I have had dinner, lunch & breakfast many times leaving happy with my meal. 
I ordered a roast beef po-boy today to go. It was the worst one I have had anywhere so I was surprised.  First, the sandwich was $21.20...ok, that's pricey but decided to grab one anyway.
It's difficult to explain what I got... mustard? Never asked for mustard & never had one with mustard. Not a fan.

The bread for the PoBoy left much to be desired. Skip it and go with the seafood platter instead. The fried catfish was so juicy, and the crust on it light and airy. Not greasy at all- they use peanut oil to fry and olive oil to grill. Great decision chef!

Wait, positive (singular). 

The location was nice. Sorry, but that was it for us. My 11 yo son, Turtle, and I noticed that there were some really good reviews and when we are traveling on vacation we like to try the local restaurants...even if not vegan. 

So the first thing we did was walk in the wrong door. They quickly let us know our error. Once inside, we grabbed the menus and followed directions to take our time while in line and order at the counter. 

The group in front of us REALLY took their time as we were stuck in line waiting for them to move. While in line, I was told multiple times that I couldn't stand were I was standing. To the point I started talking back to the staff. Ugh. 

My picky eating boy was FINALLY talked into trying something other than a cheeseburger and selected the roast beef po'boy.  

So we ordered, found a place to sit, and then had a long wait for the food. When it came out, it didn't come out all at once. 

They say they have the world's famous ham. Now, I haven't had ham in at least a couple of years, but I disagree with their statement. 

Not only that, but I think I caused my son to go back to a lifestyle of cheeseburgers. He had a single bite of his po'boy and settled on the fries. I can't blame him, that was by far the least flavor I've tasted in roast beef. 

I honestly can't see the hype, unless it's from people that haven't experienced food before.

I'm not a stickler for meat choice, but if I had an allergy or food restriction giving me non-turkey sausage would have been problematic. 

The sweet potato pie looked good, but it was thick and not sweet. It tasted like corn meal and my sister also said that her waffle tasted like jiffy cornbread.

I could have eaten every meal here during a recent weekend stay. As it happened, we only squeezed in two breakfasts at Mother's. The first time I stuffed myself with the breakfast sampler, a plate overflowing with scrambled eggs, grits, and a big helping of what they call ""debris,"" which consists of tender, lean bits of roast beef drowning in gravy. With a little salt, pepper, and hot sauce added to taste, it was delicious. The buttery, fluffy biscuit was the crown jewel, however, and that was what I craved for the next 24 hours. The following day, not having enough room to handle another breakfast sampler or the po' boys I had eyed the day before, I ordered a biscuit and a cup of jambalaya. The jambalaya was delicious and chock full of lean meat, and the biscuit, again, was the epitome of biscuit perfection.

Sounds like it would be delicious and I think it had potential but when it arrived to me it was a soggy cold mess. The red beans and rice that I ordered as a side were pretty though. My boyfriend had the ham dinner. And mind you the tag line here is worlds best baked ham. But his were 3 chunks that were dry. He pretty much eats anything so he said it was fine. He also enjoyed his sides. But you can't really mess up French fries and he also had red beans and rice. I'm gonna chalk this up to the fact that we came in an hour before closing but for a place that has such a good name for itself I'm not sure if that should matter. The high light was the sweet potato pie that I ordered. Now that was delicious. It would have been perfect if they would have just warmed it up for about 15 seconds.

Red Beans & Rice:
Just okay. Not seasoned well and a little too on the soupy side.

Jambalaya:
Of everything this tasted the best. I'd give it a B as far as New Orleans Jambalaya goes.

Solid, but no where near the best baked ham I've ever had. Again lacked flavor and slightly tough. Not tender at all.

In-laws were. I didn't mind the long line as I see that as a sign of good food. And I didn't really mind their way of ordering. The gal who took my order didn't actually log it correctly, and what she did actually log (and I paid for) was never delivered to my table. 

Now on to the food I was able to try (I was literally eating off people's plates until I got my own food). The kids chicken strips are a must-try. They are on par and really good. The kids shrimp are only ok. My husband had their ham platter (I think) and that was very good. The ham was awesome, it was like dinner ham we'd have on a holiday. The mashed potatoes were also exceptional. My mother-in-law shared her sides with me: the green beans & tomatoes were awesome (I've never thought of that combination) and the steamed cabbage looked and tasted great.

Now my actual order was their Debris PoBoy and a cup of the special of the day-a corn chowder. The Debris was not added to the order and the chowder never made it to the table-despite my paying $7 for it. Eventually I did get the Debris and it was ok. It was roast beef with coleslaw-nothing really special and very disappointing (especially after the screw-up and the wait).  I also got the Bread Pudding for dessert, and that my readers was by far the very best thing I had. If you go there, this is a must-have.  

The lady who was working the area for us was ok. She was trying to sit down and eat her lunch and she was nice after the screw up, so I won't roast her; however, there were more pleasant people working the floor. She lacked what I can only describe as ""bedside manner"". Now the only thing I can say regarding this is that tipping is literally not asked for-they actually tell you not to tip.

You order at the counter and then find a seat in one of the three dining areas. They then bring your food to the table, and as the server noted, although the sign says no tipping, you can and are encouraged especially since the signs are from years ago.

I don't eat spicy foods so I was scared to eat most of the food in Louisiana due to their cajun flair. Flavor isn't my issue. Spicyness is and my tastebuds are quite sensitive.

Service: The waitstaff and cashiers were full of southern hospitality. If there was a host or hostess, I did not encounter them. You basically stand in line and place your order once you get to the cashier's station. After you place your order, you take your number to a table of your choosing and a member of the waitstaff will bring your order to you. Our waiter was so much fun. His sense of humor was perfect! 

Food: Due to my sensitivity, I felt safe ordering a shrimp po-boy after I was assured the shrimp was not spicy. I asked for extra mayo on the side just in case. Turns out I didn't need the extra mayo because the shrimp wasn't spicy at all, yet it was flavorful so YAY! The cheesy grits were delish and OH SO cheesy! My sister needed something sweet after our meal so she got the bread pudding with brandy sauce. BABY YES! She also got the red beans and rice which did not look appealing to me. She said they were pretty good in taste. 

Odds & Ends: From what I could tell, there was no parking for this location. Upon first entry, it looks like the place is a small hole in the wall. Well, it's much bigger in space than it appears because there is an entire seating section on the opposite side of the kitchen wall. WHOA the extra space!

They had signs up saying to have your COVID card ready but the guy didnt even look at ours. Once we got inside the ordering process was hectic, confusing, and very inefficient. The line to order inside is right next to where all the side dishes are and one panel was open so anyone in line could breathe all over the food which was very unappetizing.

I stayed at a hotel across the street and decided to try it for breakfast one morning.  When I walked in, I was immediately asked for proof of vaccination.  This appears to be a state mandate.  I am not bothered by this, but you should know it is required before arriving. 

I was directed to a counter after I was handed a menu.  I ordered a breakfast plate and a diet coke.  I then went to a table where I handed my ticket to someone running the food out.  When I needed a refill I walked to the counter, but eventually someone arrived and offered to get a refill for me. Half of the time I got my own refill, the other half it was obtained for me.  

The food really was amazing, but the staff are a bit put off at answering questions. I don't know if this is a part of the experience or a result of the holiday, but it was a bit shocking at how grumpy basically everyone appeared to be.  

I returned the next morning and ordered the same thing.  The same waitress obtained my receipt and brought my food.  She said something about tipping at the table.

It wasn't clear to me that tipping was expected or warranted given the overall lack of service, but I don't mind.

I am so glad we did. I honestly think it was one of the top meals I had in our first trip to NOLA. EVERYONE ORDER THE CRAWFISH ETOUFFEE! You need to try it. Also get the grits with cheese, hands down best I've ever had. I also ordered the Turnip Greens, I love greens anywhere but these were just perfect with my meal.

It was within walking distance of our room which made it even better. There was a little line which moved pretty quick but as we were standing looking at the food I had doubts about eating here. It looks buffet like on the other side of the counter and some of the food looked like it had been sitting for awhile. The restaurant itself was dirty and in need of a good cleaning. After we ordered our food we all discussed our doubts of eating and the uncleanliness. But we decided the food must taste really good. A kid came over to our table and took our receipts and said he was going to get our food and refill our drinks as needed. He also said he would appreciate a tip if the service was good. We saw signs on the walls that said no tips allowed. Go figure???

Our food came and left so much to be desired. They are famous for their Famous Ferdi Special and ""World's Best Ham"". Yeah not anymore. The red beans and rice had no flavor at all. Zip zilch nada. The sausage didn't even have any flavor. Cheryl had the crawfish etouffee which she said was ok but barely had any crawfish. The Famous Ferdi Special was supposed to have baked ham, roast beef and debris with gravy. The sandwich was cold, the bottom a soggy mess and legit only one piece of thin ass ham and roast beef which looked like it came out of a can and the debris/gravy (the best part of the entire meal). 

We were so disappointed. During our time in NOLA we asked several of our Uber drivers (who were born and raised in NOLA))about Mothers and to our surprise the locals all agreed. They said Mother's changed owners a few years back and the food has gone way downhill. When we asked why they always had long lines one gentleman said why did you go there? Touch√©!

I expected more since every time I come to New Orleans there is a very long line outside. I came down with a group for new years, and since the sugar bowl crowd wasn't in town yet and there was no line outside, we decided to check it out. 

Since we had a large group we told one person to sit down and reserve a table... Big mistake. A worker promptly came over and said ""you need a receipt before you can sit down,"" even though there was hardly a line inside... O well. 

I am happy I read the yelp reviews before coming here that warned you to ""know what you want"" before it is time to order because as soon as you walk up to the counter, the uninviting workers rushed you through the process. My sister made the mistake of trying to order a water after being told the price. The worker kept repeating the price louder and louder as my sister asked for water, and the worker finally said, ""they will give it to you at the table."" The attitude of the worker was unnecessary. I don't understand why she didn't say that when my sister first asked. 

Once we sat down we noticed a sign that said ""no tipping"" but when our waiter came over, the first thing she said was ""Feel free to tip if I do a good job!"" HUH?!?! Needless to say we were all confused, but since she was so sweet (the only nice person we encountered here) I did in the end. 

As for the food, I wasnt a fan of the ettouffee. It was too bland in my opinion. One person in our group ordered the jambalaya, I thought the flavors in that were very good, but there was very little meat. 

Being originally from Louisiana, this restaurant embarrassed me...From the food to the staff to the confusing signs. As for the warehouse looking interior that some people have complained about, that is typical rustic new orleans and I didn't have an issue with it.

Simply put? The best sandwich on the planet second only to.....nothing. Ham is sweet and salty. The roast beef is medium rare. The combination of the dressed po' boy (that is served with shredded cabbage, mayo, mustard, pickles and ""creole"" spice combination) with soft bread, fiery spice, rich gravy and mayo induced creaminess is truly special.

Fried chicken - a half fried chicken is a huge bird - thighs, leg, breast, wing. Ultra crispy breading. Salted and peppered so that it is noticeably right. Tender meat. Juices explode without burning the lips. 

The rice and red beans have a layer of tender rice covered by a luscious and rich topping of red beans. This serving is by no means a vegetarian dish and the thick renderings of ham and pork simmered with onions, chili and beans is self evident.

It's set up like a cafeteria style line. The pace is hectic and seating is cramped. We placed our orders, paid and found seating in the back area. The building is definitely old, but that doesn't bother me (as long as the food is good).
A server sat us at a small table along the wall. She then came back and told us to move because the table wouldn't be large enough for all our food. I thought that was nice.
We didn't have to wait long. And I was glad we had a larger table. At one point, I dropped my fork and asked our server for another. She was standing on the other side of the table beside us. She handed two rolls of silverware to a lady eating at the table and sternly told her to hand them to me. I thought it was the funniest thing ever! Her tone meant business! The lady was a good sport and made a joke about it.

Breakfast is served all day, so that's what I ordered: waffle, black ham, egg white omelet with onion, green pepper, spinach, mushroom. Ham was delicious, reminded of childhood dinners at my Grandmother's. Waffle was good, omelet was okay.  It came with half a plate of grits that I didn't touch.
He ordered the Combination Platter: red beans & rice, jambalaya, shrimp creole, potato salad, turnip greens. He didn't seem too impressed. The couple of bites I tried weren't special.

The fact that he was not personable and is the first person you meet as you enter the restaurant. Well that's just bad business management. Food was bland, but edible. Absolutely nothing to write the family about. But prices for this blah were outrageous!
      
     This place truly takes you back to the 1800s. It started with the all white military wall (I'm of color and a veteran). The only faces of color were the celebrities that have visited many eons ago. The waitstaff are all people of color and they are meticulously watched, micromanaged and seemingly frustrated by the owners. Or at least the men I assumed were the owners (wearing red shirts). At first I thought it was just me, until our waitress whispered to us we could leave a tip for her if we were so inclined. I thought that was odd...but then I noticed the posted signs about not tipping the waitstaff. Where they do that at?! No tips...so you don't value your employees or want them to be compensated for their service? It felt like I was watching indentured slavery at its finest. I'm from Louisiana, live in San Antonio now and I've never seen anything like it.

It is a cafeteria style place, ordering at the counter then paying before having your meal brought to you. Every employee we interacted with was friendly and full of southern hospitality.

I'll relate my experience last evening, and y'all can decide for yourselves about this venerable (since1938) eatery.

The concept of queuing up ala Cafe du Monde, to impress the tourists who will then think it MUST be Sooo good is wearing a bit thin....but since I hadn't been to Mother's for more than a decade, and was passing the door on my bike...coming home from Wednesday In Lafayette Square concert...and there was NO LINE UP( at that moment)
....just a really friendly old sherrif at the door conducting the greeting.... I chained up my bike and went in with the menu he handed me.

Over the years, I've become dairy free. It's important to me to stay healthy when I dine out, so I scour that menu....It warns of : PIG & GLUTEN FREE, but no dairy? so I enquire of the really lovely gent (Sherrif) and he isn't sure so I wait to speak to a staff member...meanwhile more diners come into the restaurant, so I wave them past me.
The process is to queue up, pay a cashier as one orders, take a receipt, find one's own table, and the meal will arrive later at one's table.
I speak to another staff member, and he doesn't know about dairy free, so I explain; butter, cream, milk etc. in the recipe.

He leaves me standing there and I join the queue, hoping to speak to cashier when I get there, or another staff member whom the previous TWO have enquired on my behalf...Patiently waited in that queue....
No further ahead in my quest to discover which menu item I can eat,
After 20 minutes, I excuse myself, 'on my bike' and go home for a snack (where I KNOW whats in the food). Basic stuff really.

Question?
should this be a one or two star experience?

since they didn't take my $ 1st....... faint hope clause suggests it's not all bad. got my time,yes....but not $....hence 2.

If management monitors this forum, happen they'll 'reach out', and have a talk with me.

I usually like to give a thoughtful and detailed review to help folks in making a decision, but I don't have much to say about Mother's. First time visitors beware, they are not very patient if you don't know what you want to order nor are they very helpful when you ask for recommendations. Best to view a menu prior to coming or grab one and look while in line. 

Mother's is a place where the price EXCEEDS the taste. I had the seafood platter which consists of fried shrimp, oysters and catfish. I substituted more shrimp for the oysters (which didn't seem like more @ all) and also had french fries and red beans w/rice as a side. Although none of the food was terrible, the only thing worth mentioning is the shrimp, which tasted like they were seasoned with a standard Old Bay rub. The catfish was bland and a little dry and the red beans didn't have much flavor either, which surprised me considering this is a pretty standard dish in New Orleans. 

Overall I paid $25 for this plate (not counting gratuity) when I could have went to Johnny's and got a Po'boy with better shrimp, catfish and fries for $10. If you want to eat at a landmark institution featured on TV, then go for the experience. I have read better reviews of their food, so it may be worth trying a different dish. But based solely on this experience, once would be enough.",2011-07-30 12:51:24,25.0,1472,25.0,0.09090909090909091,0.09090909090909091,0.6516075439283587,0.6516075439283587

A good majority recommended coming to Mother's. This was our first proper meal in NOLA and we were ravenously hungry, sustaining ourselves off Sun Chips, Dunkin Donuts and granola bars from the airport. 

We were warned there will always be a line. A line to get inside, then a line inside to order. Again, if the food is good enough I'm always willing to wait. It was a bit frustrating because there were 2 women in front of us and apparently they were trying to get ahead because they had a party of legit 25-30 people following suit. However, we fell in line behind these women and then the part of 30 was behind us and they tried to communicate and it was very uncomfortable.

The line went pretty fast. Apart from that, I ordered a small Grilled Shrimp Po Boy and a bowl of Mae's File Gumbo. My friend got the Famous Ferdi Special Po Boy and potato salad. My boss recommended this specific dish. He was raving about the meat. However, my friend didn't love it because the sauce made the bread soggy and who likes soggy bread? He tried to eat it with a knife and fork and it just got messy. My Po Boy was meh, it wasn't as great as everyone deemed it to be. Maybe this wasn't the place for a Po Boy, I'm not sure. The gumbo was just alright, we had to add salt to taste. The sausage wasn't as flavorful as it looked to be.

HOWEVER, the service here is phenomenal. Mid Po Boy, my friend was thirsting for a Coke. There was a long line, so he went up the to the cashier and asked if he had to wait in line just to get a coke. The employee told him not to worry about it and handed him a coke. When my friend was about to pay, the employee said it was on the house. We Bostonian's are not used to Southern hospitality and the small act of kindness jumped start our trip to a great start.

Would I come back? Probably not.",2018-06-02 12:52:33,20.0,1917,20.0,0.05390835579514825,0.05390835579514825,0.4567924732183545,0.4567924732183545

Places cannot be rated all the same way of course and one should know what they are stepping into before going and being disappointed at the style. This is a diner/cafeteria style place with decent dining rooms and a very rustic almost Katrina damaged look. It may well be actual damage but honestly it has that gritty New Orleans feel that must be felt in a trip. We ordered the combo plate and ham on the side so we could taste everything. First of all that was a feat in itself! Choices choices delicious choices! Appropriately called ""Mother's"" it is food you would have someone's loving Southern mother cook for you. Our plate had creole green beans (made with tomato..yummy), potato salad-creamy good, shrimp creole on rice (wonderful!) and jambalaya(sausage and chicken)--of course so good!! The ham off the bone on the side was great too. They had this delightful pepper vinegar on the tables too which was so perfect on anything but really none of the dishes needed extra anything at all. Our server was a wonderful young man and we wanted to try the bread pudding so he just took cash and got it for us...you will need like 3 or 4 people to eat this yummyness! It was served warm --I have never had a bread pudding like this before--an experience i itself!
